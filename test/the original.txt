uid01021b8c.msg:0036:0x00000B9A:0050:1=Hajime-san, I suggest you be careful wandering around.
uid01021b8c.msg:0035:0x00000BD1:005c:2=You're a ronin, and a suspicious-lookin' one at that.
uid01021b8c.msg:0038:0x00000C07:0068:3=You think the Shinsengumi's gonna kill me just for that?
uid01021b8c.msg:0067:0x00000C40:0074:4=Oh yes. They brag about keeping Kyo safe, but all that means is they'll cut down anyone for any reason.
uid01021b8c.msg:0056:0x00000CA8:0080:5=Ever since the Bakufu let them loose, the streets have been turning redder with blood.
uid01021b8c.msg:000d:0x00000CFF:008c:6=So they have.
uid01021b8c.msg:005b:0x00000D0D:0098:7=Wouldn't it be a pity if you ended up dead after drinking and gambling away all your money?
uid01021b8c.msg:0020:0x00000D69:00a4:8=Hmph. That's not for you to say.
uid01021b8c.msg:0026:0x00000D8A:00b0:9=Fine. But don't say I didn't warn you.
uid01021b8c.msg:0037:0x00000DB1:00bc:10=Warning me because you won't get your rent if I'm dead.
uid01021b8c.msg:001a:0x00000DE9:00c8:11=Hmph. Think what you like.
uid01021b8c.msg:006e:0x00000E08:0104:12=You can use your storage here at Ryoma's room in Teradaya.  You can also change the time in most situations.
uid01021b8c.msg:001e:0x00000E77:0110:13=(All right. Time to head out.)
uid01021b90.msg:001b:0x000013F8:0048:1=A-All right, that's enough!
uid01021b90.msg:001f:0x00001414:0054:2=We're sorry, okay!? Forgive us!
uid01021b90.msg:005a:0x00001435:006c:3=Thank you, sir! We've had to deal with so many men like that lately... You're a lifesaver!
uid01021b90.msg:0027:0x00001491:0084:4=Obtained <Color:8>1 ryo<Color:Default>.
uid01021b90.msg:0037:0x000014BC:00b4:5=One moment, please! What about the money for the sake!?
uid01021b90.msg:0011:0x000014F4:00c0:6=Put it on my tab!
uid01021b90.msg:0043:0x00001506:00cc:7=I saw you do that to some Satsuma guys yesterday! I know your game!
uid01021b90.msg:0047:0x0000154A:00d8:8=But in this case, I don't know whose tab I should put the charges on...
uid01021b90.msg:007d:0x00001592:00e4:9=Shut up! Don't you know we're loyalist shishi? We're risking our lives to fight the Bakufu, for the good of the whole nation!
uid01021b90.msg:0042:0x00001611:00fc:10=Asshole... Well? What're you doing just standing there? Apologize!
uid01021b90.msg:003b:0x0000165B:0114:11=You guys sure you wanna do this? I'll call the Shinsengumi!
uid01021b90.msg:0023:0x00001697:0120:12=What...? You bitch! Say that again!
uid01021b90.msg:0038:0x000016C0:0138:13=Hey. Apologize and give us some coin to make this right.
uid01021b90.msg:0045:0x000016F9:0144:14=Unfortunately, I have neither money nor an apology for scum like you.
uid01021b90.msg:0030:0x0000173F:0150:15=Hey, shit-for-brains! Who are you calling scum!?
uid01021b90.msg:003c:0x00001771:0168:16=I've got an idea for this bastard... A little bit of tenchu!
uid01021b90.msg:004a:0x000017AF:0180:17=(That informant's not so reliable. I should walk around the city a bit...)
uid01021ba9.msg:001d:0x000003F8:0038:1=(So this is the bathhouse...)
uid01021ba9.msg:0037:0x00000416:0044:2=(I have more things to do before I'm ready for that...)
uid01021ba9.msg:003b:0x0000044E:0050:3=(Hard to believe there's a real information broker here...)
uid01021ba9.msg:001d:0x0000048B:0068:4=(So this is the bathhouse...)
uid01021ba9.msg:0037:0x000004A9:0074:5=(I have more things to do before I'm ready for that...)
uid01021ba9.msg:003b:0x000004E1:0080:6=(Hard to believe there's a real information broker here...)
uid01021bc5.msg:004f:0x00003081:0034:1=Heh, you see that? The look on everyone's faces when I made you Representative?
uid01021bc5.msg:0052:0x000030D1:0040:2=The Loyalist Party's gotten way too rigid lately. This ought to keep things fresh.
uid01021bc5.msg:0036:0x00003124:004c:3=I dunno, Brother. I doubt the veterans will like that.
uid01021bc5.msg:0068:0x0000315B:0058:4=Eh, let 'em stir. A little fire under your ass does you good. Lose that, and things start to fall apart.
uid01021bc5.msg:0012:0x000031C4:0064:5=Just look at Tosa.
uid01021bc5.msg:001b:0x000031D7:0070:6=I guess that's true, but...
uid01021bc5.msg:0021:0x000031F4:0088:7=...Does it still hurt? Your back?
uid01021bc5.msg:0036:0x00003216:0094:8=Hm? What, this? No, no pain. Sure left a mark, though.
uid01021bc5.msg:0013:0x0000324D:00a0:9=I'm sorry, Brother.
uid01021bc5.msg:0033:0x00003261:00ac:10=Didn't I tell you to cut that out? It was ages ago.
uid01021bc5.msg:003b:0x00003295:00b8:11=Yeah, fifteen years. Still, it feels like it was yesterday.
uid01021bc5.msg:002d:0x000032D1:00c4:12=Well, it's not like I can really blame you...
uid01021bc5.msg:0058:0x000032FF:00d0:13=They burned down your house, after all. No kid should have to lose everything like that.
uid01021bc5.msg:0046:0x00003358:00dc:14=If you hadn't saved me, I would've gone with it, just like my parents.
uid01021bc5.msg:0043:0x0000339F:00e8:15=It's my fault you've got that burn on your back... I'm truly sorry.
uid01021bc5.msg:003d:0x000033E3:00f4:16=Will you quit apologizing? You've got no reason to say sorry.
uid01021bc5.msg:002f:0x00003421:0100:17=It's the joshi who wronged <i>you</i>... Right?
uid01021bc5.msg:0009:0x00003451:010c:18=...Right.
uid01021bc5.msg:004d:0x0000345B:0118:19=Ryoma... Pops and I are going to change Tosa. We want you to be a part of it.
uid01021bc5.msg:003c:0x000034A9:0124:20=He gave me the gist. But what do you actually plan on doing?
uid01021bc5.msg:0057:0x000034E6:0130:21=We're going to storm Kochi Castle, round up all 500 of us and strike the heart of Tosa.
uid01021bc5.msg:0015:0x0000353E:013c:22=Storm the castle...!?
uid01021bc5.msg:002f:0x00003554:0148:23=Don't worry, we're not planning to hurt anyone.
uid01021bc5.msg:005f:0x00003584:0154:24=We're going to surround the castle and communicate the Party's "resolve" to the old men up top.
uid01021bc5.msg:003d:0x000035E4:0160:25=From there, Pops'll issue an ultimatum for them to step down.
uid01021bc5.msg:003a:0x00003622:016c:26=If they refuse, well... We'll be more than ready for them.
uid01021bc5.msg:002b:0x0000365D:0178:27=And the Loyalist Party's their replacement?
uid01021bc5.msg:007b:0x00003689:0184:28=Exactly. We're a looming threat. Make the joshi fear for their lives, and they'll finally realize how foolish they've been.
uid01021bc5.msg:0051:0x00003705:0190:29=You might call it extreme, but it's just the thing Tosa needs in order to change.
uid01021bc5.msg:0008:0x00003757:019c:30=I see...
uid01021bc5.msg:0068:0x00003760:01a8:31=It's the same as when the Black Ships first arrived. People panic when their backs are against the wall.
uid01021bc5.msg:0056:0x000037C9:01b4:32=They start thinking about what they can do differently. That's what this is all about.
uid01021bc5.msg:0040:0x00003820:01c0:33=And Pops has had this planned since the days at the schoolhouse?
uid01021bc5.msg:0055:0x00003861:01cc:34=That's my guess. He had you learn the way of the sword and me academics and politics.
uid01021bc5.msg:0014:0x000038B7:01d8:35=It was all for this.
uid01021bc5.msg:0035:0x000038CC:01e4:36=I had no idea... I can't imagine I'll be of much use.
uid01021bc5.msg:000f:0x00003902:01f0:37=Hm? Why's that?
uid01021bc5.msg:005d:0x00003912:01fc:38=The days of swordsmen are long gone. Even you had all the loyalists using pistols back there.
uid01021bc5.msg:007d:0x00003970:0208:39=Yeah, well, that's because they lack the talent. You can teach sword technique all you want, but that's only half the battle.
uid01021bc5.msg:005f:0x000039EE:0214:40=Guns aren't like that. Anyone can be useful with enough practice. They level the playing field.
uid01021bc5.msg:0015:0x00003A4E:0220:41=Level the field, huh?
uid01021bc5.msg:0030:0x00003A64:022c:42=Ryoma, I want to tear Tosa's class system apart.
uid01021bc5.msg:0044:0x00003A95:0238:43=But even if I do make that happen, people will never truly be equal.
uid01021bc5.msg:007d:0x00003ADA:0244:44=There will always be those with talent and those without... Remove class structure, and a new wall's bound to take its place.
uid01021bc5.msg:005e:0x00003B58:0250:45=I want to create a world for the one without an education, or the one who can't wield a sword.
uid01021bc5.msg:0038:0x00003BB7:025c:46=I want a world where even they have a shot at happiness.
uid01021bc5.msg:000a:0x00003BF0:0268:47=Brother...
uid01021bc5.msg:0032:0x00003BFB:0274:48=Take this. The Loyalists will be glad to have you.
uid01021bc5.msg:007c:0x00003C2F:028c:49=There will come a day when we won't have to depend on swords or guns anymore... A day when people can truly be called equal.
uid01021bc5.msg:0025:0x00003CAC:0298:50=Will you fight at my side until then?
uid01021bc5.msg:0033:0x00003CD4:02bc:51=Join me and the rest of the Loyalist Party. Please.
uid01021bc5.msg:000d:0x00003D0A:02e0:52=Okay, I will.
uid01021bc5.msg:0058:0x00003D18:02ec:53=Excellent! I'm actually meeting with Pops at Kochi Castle tonight to plan our next move.
uid01021bc5.msg:001b:0x00003D71:02f8:54=Why don't you come with me?
uid01021bc5.msg:0020:0x00003D8D:0304:55=You can meet him just like that?
uid01021bc5.msg:0053:0x00003DAE:0310:56=One of his subordinates is supposed to lead me to him once I arrive. It'll be fine.
uid01021bc5.msg:000a:0x00003E02:031c:57=All right.
uid01021bc5.msg:003d:0x00003E0D:0328:58=Kill some time outside. I've got some stuff to do beforehand.
uid01021bc9.msg:0008:0x00000AE0:0048:1=U-Ugh...
uid01021bc9.msg:001a:0x00000AE9:0054:2=Otsu! What's wrong, Otsu!?
uid01021bc9.msg:001c:0x00000B04:0060:3=Please! Is anyone a doctor!?
uid01021bc9.msg:002f:0x00000B21:006c:4=What happened!? I'm a doctor. I'll take a look.
uid01021bc9.msg:002e:0x00000B51:0078:5=Her stomach started hurting all of a sudden...
uid01021bc9.msg:002a:0x00000B80:0084:6=This isn't good. It could be her appendix.
uid01021bc9.msg:000b:0x00000BAB:0090:7=A-Appendix?
uid01021bc9.msg:0057:0x00000BB7:009c:8=Her stomach organs are likely inflamed. This is something only Dutch medicine can mend.
uid01021bc9.msg:0008:0x00000C0F:00a8:9=N-No...!
uid01021bc9.msg:001a:0x00000C18:00b4:10=We need to move her, fast!
uid01021bc9.msg:0029:0x00000C33:00c0:11=Hey! Can someone help me move this girl!?
uid01021bc9.msg:0029:0x00000C60:00f0:12=(It's been a year since I last saw Tosa.)
uid01021bc9.msg:0029:0x00000C8A:00fc:13=(I wonder if everyone's doing all right.)
uid01021bc9.msg:0029:0x00000CB4:0108:14=(I should see how the town's holding up.)
uid01021bcd.msg:0027:0x00001B59:0034:1=Welcome to our organization, Saito-san.
uid01021bcd.msg:003d:0x00001B83:0058:2=Strange welcome if you ask me. There's nowhere for me to sit.
uid01021bcd.msg:003b:0x00001BC2:0070:3=Pay that no mind. There are other rooms with other seating.
uid01021bcd.msg:0036:0x00001BFE:007c:4=Besides, who would want blood all over their cushions?
uid01021bcd.msg:003a:0x00001C38:00a0:5=I'm aware you have an interest in the Tennen Rishin style.
uid01021bcd.msg:0041:0x00001C73:00ac:6=Oh... It's just a passing curiosity. I wouldn't call it interest.
uid01021bcd.msg:0095:0x00001CB6:00c4:7=Tennen Rishin is a parochial style taught only in Edo. Most people's curiosity stops at Hokushin Itto and Shindo Munen. But clearly you're different.
uid01021bcd.msg:0015:0x00001D4F:00f4:8=What's he doing here?
uid01021bcd.msg:004e:0x00001D65:0100:9=Just like Okita and Nagakura, this man is skilled in the way of Tennen Rishin.
uid01021bcd.msg:002b:0x00001DB5:0118:10=Right now, you will fight him to the death.
uid01021bcd.msg:000d:0x00001DE3:013c:11=Ridiculous...
uid01021bcd.msg:0036:0x00001DF1:0148:12=The Shinsengumi are required to kill without question.
uid01021bcd.msg:0068:0x00001E28:0154:13=To do so, you must be free of frivolous emotion and moral inhibition. Those things will only hinder you.
uid01021bcd.msg:0081:0x00001E98:016c:14=Already, I can see you have a soft heart. That's a death sentence in our line of work, so consider this a test of your character.
uid01021bcd.msg:0028:0x00001F1A:0178:15=You want me to kill someone as a "test"?
uid01021bcd.msg:0062:0x00001F43:0184:16=Precisely. You should have no issue taking a life. That is, if you consider yourself worthy of us.
uid01021bcd.msg:0063:0x00001FA8:01a8:17=Saito-san. This man is fully prepared to strike you down without mercy. I suggest you emulate this.
uid01021bcd.msg:0024:0x0000200D:01c0:18=So you're saying I have no choice...
uid01021bcd.msg:0041:0x00002033:01d8:19=Correct. Only one of you will leave this room alive. Get ready...
uid01021bcd.msg:000a:0x00002076:01f0:20=And begin!
uid01021bd5.msg:002c:0x000007C4:0028:1=I see they've given you the royal treatment.
uid01021bd5.msg:000c:0x000007F1:0034:2=Pops... I...
uid01021bd5.msg:005c:0x000007FE:0040:3=Say no more. It won't do us any good if the jailor catches us... Get dressed, we're leaving.
uid01021bd5.msg:0008:0x0000085B:004c:4=But how?
uid01021bd5.msg:0053:0x00000864:0058:5=Don't worry, I've cleared an escape for us. But only for a short time, so hurry up.
uid01021bd5.msg:000a:0x000008B8:0064:6=R-Right...
uid01021bd5.msg:0077:0x000008C3:0070:7=I'll spare you the details for now. First, get yourself something to eat, then meet me at the hideout when you're done.
uid01021bd5.msg:000c:0x0000093B:007c:8=The hideout?
uid01021bd5.msg:005e:0x00000948:0088:9=Heh, did you forget already? The school you grew up in. What a year in Edo will do to a man...
uid01021bd5.msg:0051:0x000009A7:0094:10=You can get directions from people around town. Ask for the Kengoshi Schoolhouse.
uid01021bd5.msg:000a:0x000009F9:00a0:11=All right.
uid01021bd9.msg:0025:0x00000CA0:0048:1=(I can probably go in from the back.)
uid01021bd9.msg:0019:0x00000CC8:006c:2=Hm...? Whoa, you him...!?
uid01021bd9.msg:0007:0x00000CE2:0078:3=Him...?
uid01021bd9.msg:0038:0x00000CEA:0084:4=The tough fella that smacked around those joshi earlier?
uid01021bd9.msg:0039:0x00000D2A:009c:5=Heh. Nah, no way. They hauled that guy off lickety-split.
uid01021bd9.msg:0029:0x00000D64:00a8:6=He's probably missing his head about now.
uid01021bd9.msg:002f:0x00000D95:00c0:7=I guess so... He did the right thing, at least.
uid01021bd9.msg:0081:0x00000DC5:00cc:8=Yeah. We got enough problems, what with the Black Ships and the threat of invasion and the like, but Tosa hasn't changed, no sir.
uid01021bd9.msg:002d:0x00000E47:00d8:9=Sorry. Guess we mistook you for someone else.
uid01021bd9.msg:0054:0x00000E75:00e4:10=But if you're looking to spark some change, you oughta join the Tosa Loyalist Party.
uid01021bd9.msg:001c:0x00000ECA:00f0:11=Takechi-sensei welcomes all.
uid01021bd9.msg:0045:0x00000EE7:00fc:12=(All right, I should head to the hideout. Pops'll be waiting for me.)
uid01021bd9.msg:0040:0x00000F2D:0108:13=(Kengoshi Schoolhouse... Damn, I completely forgot where it is.)
uid01021bd9.msg:0019:0x00000F6E:0114:14=(I should ask someone...)
uid01021bd9.msg:0049:0x00000F89:012c:15=(Thought maybe that was it for me... I caused a lot of trouble for Pops.)
uid01021bd9.msg:0048:0x00000FD3:0138:16=(All this relief's making me hungry, too... Guess I should grab a bite.)
uid01021be0.msg:0032:0x00000110:0028:1=(Okay, this is it. Pops should be waiting inside.)
uid01021be1.msg:0085:0x00002849:0034:1=I send you out all the way to Edo, and just look at you. Guess it was silly to think a little sword training would make a difference.
uid01021be1.msg:004e:0x000028CF:0040:2=Starting a fight with a joshi right off the boat... You haven't changed a bit.
uid01021be1.msg:0069:0x0000291E:004c:3=It's the joshi who haven't changed. Seeing Edo made me realize just how backwards Tosa's class system is.
uid01021be1.msg:002f:0x00002988:0058:4=Heh... Perhaps the training paid off after all.
uid01021be1.msg:003f:0x000029B8:0064:5=Are you going to be okay after what you just pulled back there?
uid01021be1.msg:0019:0x000029F8:0070:6=You mean letting you out?
uid01021be1.msg:0083:0x00002A12:007c:7=You're the magistrate of Tosa, aren't you? If word gets out you let a criminal walk, someone's bound to try and use it against you.
uid01021be1.msg:002e:0x00002A96:0088:8=You mean like Tosa's high and mighty elders...
uid01021be1.msg:0050:0x00002AC5:0094:9=No need to worry. That jailor was a "high goshi." He won't cause us any trouble.
uid01021be1.msg:0011:0x00002B16:00a0:10=What do you mean?
uid01021be1.msg:004c:0x00002B28:00ac:11=High goshi is the rank between joshi and goshi. Somewhere between you and I.
uid01021be1.msg:0050:0x00002B75:00b8:12=If anything were to happen, he'd be demoted. And that's the last thing he wants.
uid01021be1.msg:003c:0x00002BC6:00c4:13=A man who suckles at power like that wouldn't have the guts.
uid01021be1.msg:000b:0x00002C03:00d0:14=I guess so.
uid01021be1.msg:0071:0x00002C0F:00dc:15=It's true. People who can defy the joshi without thinking of the consequences, people like you, are much scarier.
uid01021be1.msg:001a:0x00002C81:00e8:16=Take it from a magistrate.
uid01021be1.msg:0026:0x00002C9C:00f4:17=...This place sure is showing its age.
uid01021be1.msg:002b:0x00002CC3:0100:18=Yeah. Well, it might be old, but it's home.
uid01021be1.msg:002f:0x00002CEF:010c:19=I can still remember. It's been over ten years.
uid01021be1.msg:0007:0x00002D1F:0118:20=Yeah...
uid01021be1.msg:0044:0x00002D27:0124:21=Many children were orphaned because of the joshi. You weren't alone.
uid01021be1.msg:0062:0x00002D73:013c:22=I created this school to take in as many like you as possible, and keep the domain none the wiser.
uid01021be1.msg:0057:0x00002DD6:0148:23=I still don't really get it. You're a joshi yourself, Pops. Why do something like that?
uid01021be1.msg:006d:0x00002E2E:0154:24=Well, I'm not entirely sure... One thing I do know, however, is that I hate Tosa more and more with each day.
uid01021be1.msg:000e:0x00002E9C:0160:25=You hate Tosa?
uid01021be1.msg:0029:0x00002EAB:016c:26=I do. In a place like Tosa, class is law.
uid01021be1.msg:0057:0x00002ED5:0178:27=Even the classes have classes, like "joshi," "high goshi," and "goshi" for the samurai.
uid01021be1.msg:0063:0x00002F2D:0184:28=The Tosa Domain established these ranks and retained order by putting up whatever walls they could.
uid01021be1.msg:006e:0x00002F91:0190:29=But warriors, peasants, merchants, women and children—we're all just flesh and blood. There's no difference.
uid01021be1.msg:0005:0x00003000:019c:30=Yeah.
uid01021be1.msg:0058:0x00003006:01a8:31=That's why I took you and all those others who'd been wronged by Tosa into the school...
uid01021be1.msg:002f:0x0000305F:01b4:32=I sought to raise people who might change Tosa.
uid01021be1.msg:001f:0x0000308F:01c0:33=You want people to change Tosa?
uid01021be1.msg:0056:0x000030AF:01cc:34=That's right. Those who have been tamed by the class system aren't much good for that.
uid01021be1.msg:0083:0x00003106:01d8:35=Here's my philosophy, Ryoma. I believe that in order to truly change Tosa, you need to both love and hate it more than anyone else.
uid01021be1.msg:007b:0x00003191:01f0:36=Fifteen years ago, the joshi burned your home and took everything from you... Surely, you must want things to be different.
uid01021be1.msg:0007:0x0000320E:0208:37=Pops...
uid01021be1.msg:0003:0x00003216:0214:38=Mm?
uid01021be1.msg:003a:0x0000321A:0220:39=If you really feel this way, then why work for the domain?
uid01021be1.msg:0006:0x00003255:022c:40=Hrm...
uid01021be1.msg:003b:0x0000325C:0238:41=Isn't it the magistrate's job to maintain the class system?
uid01021be1.msg:006f:0x00003298:0244:42=Indeed it is. And I have a reputation for prizing order, much like our class system... At least on the surface.
uid01021be1.msg:0003:0x00003308:0250:43=Hm?
uid01021be1.msg:0025:0x0000330C:025c:44=Ryoma, have you met with Takechi yet?
uid01021be1.msg:0018:0x00003332:0268:45=My brother? No, not yet.
uid01021be1.msg:0031:0x0000334B:0274:46=He took on an important role while you were gone.
uid01021be1.msg:0007:0x0000337D:0280:47=He did?
uid01021be1.msg:0044:0x00003385:028c:48=Yes. I had him form an organization we call the Tosa Loyalist Party.
uid01021be1.msg:001a:0x000033CA:0298:49=The Tosa Loyalist Party...
uid01021be1.msg:004b:0x000033E5:02a4:50=500 men, mostly goshi, who, like us, are unhappy with Tosa's current state.
uid01021be1.msg:0084:0x00003431:02b0:51=To those on the outside, they call themselves loyalists, but they've really only one true goal: to abolish the class system in Tosa.
uid01021be1.msg:0032:0x000034B6:02bc:52=Meaning the Loyalist Party's enemy is Tosa itself?
uid01021be1.msg:0030:0x000034E9:02c8:53=Listen, Ryoma. I want the party to destroy Tosa.
uid01021be1.msg:0008:0x0000351A:02d4:54=Destroy?
uid01021be1.msg:0043:0x00003523:02e0:55=Correct. And I want it led by the two men I consider my own sons...
uid01021be1.msg:0024:0x00003567:02ec:56=Takechi Hanpeita and Sakamoto Ryoma.
uid01021be1.msg:0033:0x00003594:0310:57=Ryoma, go see Takechi. Have him bring you on board.
uid01021be1.msg:004a:0x000035C8:031c:58=He'll fill you in on all the details. It's time I head back to the castle.
uid01021be1.msg:0015:0x00003613:0328:59=Where can I find him?
uid01021be1.msg:0074:0x00003629:0334:60=Most everyone in Tosa's heard of Takechi and the Loyalist Party. Meeting him might prove a little difficult, though.
uid01021be1.msg:0003:0x0000369E:0340:61=Oh?
uid01021be7.msg:0019:0x00001AB0:0058:1=What's wrong? Had enough?
uid01021be7.msg:0016:0x00001ACA:0064:2=P-Please, we're sorry!
uid01021be7.msg:0046:0x00001AE1:0070:3=...We're just ronin. Nothing to do with the Loyalist Party, you know!?
uid01021be7.msg:004a:0x00001B28:007c:4=Th-The real Loyalist Party'll be conducting lessons at the dojo about now!
uid01021be7.msg:0028:0x00001B73:0088:5=Run up the stairs there, then head east!
uid01021be7.msg:0033:0x00001B9C:0094:6=We're late for a meeting, so... T-Take care, yeah!?
uid01021be7.msg:0024:0x00001BD2:00b8:7=Splendid! Fancy swordplay, that was!
uid01021be7.msg:000c:0x00001BF7:00c4:8=Who are you?
uid01021be7.msg:006e:0x00001C04:00d0:9=The name's Shimada Yahei of the Tosa Loyalist Party. Caught a glimmer of your skills, I did... Sakamoto Ryoma.
uid01021be7.msg:0012:0x00001C73:00dc:10=You know who I am?
uid01021be7.msg:005b:0x00001C86:00e8:11=Naturally. Your face and form tell all. No mistaking it—it's just as Takechi-sensei said.
uid01021be7.msg:000f:0x00001CE2:00f4:12=Takechi-sensei?
uid01021be7.msg:003c:0x00001CF2:0100:13=Founder of the Tosa Loyalist Party, Takechi Hanpeita-sensei.
uid01021be7.msg:0018:0x00001D2F:010c:14=...Did you say "sensei"?
uid01021be7.msg:0051:0x00001D48:0118:15=Haha! Rare thing to be both scholar and warrior, so we've all pledged allegiance!
uid01021be7.msg:003d:0x00001D9A:0124:16=He's been teaching us goshi how to live good and proper-like.
uid01021be7.msg:0058:0x00001DD8:0130:17=Yes sir, if anything's fit to change the country, it's Takechi-sensei and the loyalists.
uid01021be7.msg:0062:0x00001E38:0148:18=Those ronin have been causing a fair deal of trouble in our name. Been giving us a right headache.
uid01021be7.msg:002d:0x00001E9B:0154:19=By the way, Takechi-sensei's looking for you.
uid01021be7.msg:000f:0x00001EC9:0160:20=Looking for me?
uid01021be7.msg:004d:0x00001ED9:016c:21=The dojo's in the middle of training, but you've special permission to enter.
uid01021be7.msg:007b:0x00001F27:0178:22=I'll give word to the fellas out front, so head in at your leisure. Takechi-sensei'll welcome you with open arms, I'm sure!
uid01021be7.msg:0014:0x00001FA5:019c:23=Go on, fork it over!
uid01021be7.msg:0006:0x00001FBA:01a8:24=Eek...
uid01021be7.msg:004b:0x00001FC1:01b4:25=The Tosa Loyalist Party some kinda joke to you? Your protection money, now!
uid01021be7.msg:0060:0x0000200D:01c0:26=There's no way Takechi-sensei would do something like this! You're no more a loyalist than I am!
uid01021be7.msg:0041:0x0000206E:01cc:27=Shut it! Or shall we show you what happens when you don't pay up?
uid01021be7.msg:004a:0x000020B6:01f0:28=Give me a break. Don't tell me the loyalists are just a bunch of lowlifes.
uid01021be7.msg:0036:0x00002101:01fc:29=P-Please help! These fakes are trying to clean me out!
uid01021be7.msg:0041:0x00002138:0208:30=Who're you supposed to be? You want an early grave, then step up!
uid01021be7.msg:005b:0x0000217A:0214:31=All right, fine. I'll take you guys on. I've been wanting to test out my new skills anyway.
uid01021be7.msg:0042:0x000021D6:0220:32=Got some nerve, this one... No pulling punches, then! Run him red!
uid01021be7.msg:003a:0x0000221A:0238:33=(Pops wants me to meet with Takechi. I should ask around.)
uid01021bed.msg:0020:0x00001025:0064:1=Gagh! Regular behemoth, he is...
uid01021bed.msg:0019:0x00001046:0070:2=Well? You had enough yet?
uid01021bed.msg:001d:0x00001060:007c:3=Damn you! I'll remember this!
uid01021bed.msg:005e:0x00001082:00b8:4=(What a waste of time. Takechi's probably ready to go by now. I should head back to the dojo.)
uid01021bed.msg:0017:0x000010E2:00d0:5=Heh... There's our man.
uid01021bed.msg:0013:0x000010FC:00f4:6=Hm? Can I help you?
uid01021bed.msg:0016:0x00001110:0100:7=Sakamoto Ryoma, right?
uid01021bed.msg:000d:0x00001127:010c:8=That's right.
uid01021bed.msg:005e:0x00001135:0118:9=I heard you showed my boys here a good time. So good, in fact, we're damn near out of the job.
uid01021bed.msg:0036:0x0000119B:0130:10=Hate to say it, but your time's up. Rotten luck, that.
uid01021bed.msg:0023:0x000011D2:013c:11=Spare nothing, lads! Off him clean!
uid01021bed.msg:0029:0x000011F7:0154:12=Obtained <Color:8>Model 2<Color:Default>.
uid01021bed.msg:002e:0x00001222:016c:13=Obtained <Color:8>Flame Rounds<Color:Default>.
uid01021bed.msg:0031:0x00001252:0184:14=Obtained <Color:8>Enhanced Rounds<Color:Default>.
uid01021bed.msg:0047:0x00001285:019c:15=(I could always grab a drink and kill some time until Takechi's ready.)
uid01021bee.msg:000e:0x000016B9:0034:1=Gugh... Ugh...
uid01021bee.msg:0011:0x000016C8:0040:2=Hey. Izo, was it?
uid01021bee.msg:0005:0x000016DA:004c:3=Hrgh?
uid01021bee.msg:005e:0x000016E0:0058:4=You're strong, there's no denying that. But if you joined the Loyalist Party solely to kill...
uid01021bee.msg:0023:0x0000173F:0064:5=Then I suggest you leave right now.
uid01021bee.msg:0004:0x00001763:0070:6=Huh?
uid01021bee.msg:003b:0x00001768:007c:7=That's not the kind of organization my brother had in mind.
uid01021bee.msg:0007:0x000017A4:0088:8=Grgh...
uid01021bee.msg:0051:0x000017AC:0094:9=Tell the others, too. If they have a problem with Sakamoto Ryoma, I'm right here.
uid01021bee.msg:0011:0x00001807:00c4:10=Sorry about them.
uid01021bee.msg:0011:0x00001819:00d0:11=You saw all that?
uid01021bee.msg:003a:0x0000182B:00dc:12=Yeah. You're definitely stronger than you were a year ago.
uid01021bee.msg:0043:0x00001866:00e8:13=What was their deal? They'll shame the loyalists, acting like that.
uid01021bee.msg:0032:0x000018AA:00f4:14=That's just the reality of the goshi here in Tosa.
uid01021bee.msg:0007:0x000018DD:0100:15=How so?
uid01021bee.msg:0053:0x000018E5:010c:16=A goshi can't get a proper education. Hell, he can't even get himself a decent job.
uid01021bee.msg:0040:0x00001939:0118:17=For men like them, the Loyalist Party's their one and only hope.
uid01021bee.msg:003d:0x0000197A:0124:18=And they're jealous I got made Representative just like that.
uid01021bee.msg:0032:0x000019B8:0130:19=Forgive them, yeah? They've got their dreams, too.
uid01021bee.msg:0071:0x000019EB:013c:20=It's why I recruited them in the first place. Every person's got the right to dream about their country's future.
uid01021bee.msg:0010:0x00001A5D:0148:21=The future, huh?
uid01021bee.msg:0078:0x00001A6E:0154:22=Right, and in order to do that, we need to rid ourselves of this class nonsense and start thinking about how to rebuild.
uid01021bee.msg:000a:0x00001AE7:0160:23=Eh, Ryoma?
uid01021bee.msg:0057:0x00001AF2:016c:24=Well, that's all a little complex for my taste, but there is one thing I do understand.
uid01021bee.msg:0010:0x00001B4A:0178:25=And what's that?
uid01021bee.msg:0040:0x00001B5B:0184:26=Tosa, the Loyalist Party, even me... We've all got room to grow.
uid01021bfc.msg:0009:0x000005CF:004c:1=Hanpeita.
uid01021bfc.msg:0010:0x000005D9:0058:2=All good, Ryoma?
uid01021bfc.msg:0069:0x000005EA:0064:3=This is the first time I've ever been inside the castle, even though it's always been looking down on me.
uid01021bfc.msg:0050:0x00000654:0070:4=...Yeah. Just how it goes for the goshi. I've only been here a few times myself.
uid01021c00.msg:0019:0x000010C5:0034:1=S-Sorry... I messed up...
uid01021c00.msg:001b:0x000010DF:0040:2=Forget that, are you okay!?
uid01021c00.msg:002f:0x000010FB:004c:3=He definitely hit bone, but I'm fine for now...
uid01021c00.msg:0038:0x0000112B:0058:4=Huff... Huff... More importantly, what happened to Pops?
uid01021c00.msg:0014:0x00001164:0064:5=He didn't make it...
uid01021c00.msg:0006:0x00001179:0070:6=Kgh...
uid01021c00.msg:003a:0x00001180:007c:7=Brother... What happened? The man in the mask, who was he?
uid01021c00.msg:0029:0x000011BB:0088:8=I don't know... Why did he come after us?
uid01021c00.msg:0023:0x000011E5:0094:9=Could he have known about our plan?
uid01021c00.msg:004a:0x00001209:00a0:10=It's possible. One of the elders must have found out and sent an assassin.
uid01021c00.msg:0034:0x00001254:00ac:11=But with Pops dead, there's no way to confirm who...
uid01021c00.msg:0026:0x00001289:00b8:12=Will we know if we capture his killer?
uid01021c00.msg:000f:0x000012B0:00c4:13=Perhaps, but...
uid01021c00.msg:001d:0x000012C0:00d0:14=Brother, I'm going after him.
uid01021c00.msg:003f:0x000012DE:00dc:15=Like hell, you are! The man's probably well out of Tosa by now.
uid01021c00.msg:0052:0x0000131E:00e8:16=You skip town, even just to hunt him down, everyone's gonna think you killed Pops!
uid01021c00.msg:0052:0x00001371:00f4:17=I'm a wanted man either way at this point. The men at the castle already think so.
uid01021c00.msg:0029:0x000013C4:0100:18=...They're going to come after me anyway.
uid01021c00.msg:0008:0x000013EE:010c:19=Ryoma...
uid01021c00.msg:0046:0x000013F8:0124:20=Ryoma, let's just get out for now. They'll find us if we stick around.
uid01021c04.msg:0012:0x000012C9:0064:1=Hey. You see them?
uid01021c04.msg:0013:0x000012DC:0070:2=Oh. Aren't they...?
uid01021c04.msg:0014:0x000012F0:007c:3=They're Shinsengumi!
uid01021c04.msg:0014:0x00001305:0088:4=Shit, let's beat it!
uid01021c04.msg:0006:0x0000131B:00a0:5=Tch...
uid01021c04.msg:001e:0x00001324:00c4:6=Oh? Could you be... Sakamoto!?
uid01021c04.msg:004a:0x00001343:00d0:7=By gum, it <i>is</i> you! Well, I'll be! It's me, Shimada Yahei from Tosa!
uid01021c04.msg:002a:0x0000138E:00dc:8=Fancy meeting you all the way here in Kyo!
uid01021c04.msg:0019:0x000013BA:00f4:9=You've got the wrong guy.
uid01021c04.msg:0057:0x000013D4:0100:10=Quit fibbing! I'd recognize our Party Rep any day! How's things been going since exile?
uid01021c04.msg:0011:0x0000142C:010c:11=Lower your voice.
uid01021c04.msg:003d:0x0000143F:0124:12=Oh... Oh no, it's the Shinsengumi! Buh—buh-bye! I gotta go!
uid01021c04.msg:001f:0x0000147D:0130:13=They're on the run! After them!
uid01021c04.msg:0004:0x0000149D:013c:14=Tch.
uid01021c05.msg:0017:0x000026BC:0028:1=All right, who are you?
uid01021c05.msg:0069:0x000026D4:0034:2=You don't remember? I was at the dojo earlier... Though, I guess I didn't exactly make my presence known.
uid01021c05.msg:0062:0x00002742:0070:3=Yeah, you can call it eavesdropping, but I call it an ear for good gossip. One of my many talents.
uid01021c05.msg:0027:0x000027A5:007c:4=That still doesn't tell me who you are.
uid01021c05.msg:006e:0x000027CD:0088:5=Aha, right. I'm Niibori Matsusuke of the Choshu Domain. Might not look it, but I'm actually a loyalist shishi.
uid01021c05.msg:0049:0x0000283C:0094:6=If the Bakufu and Shinsengumi spot me, it's my head on their platter too.
uid01021c05.msg:002b:0x00002886:00a0:7=I see. So then... is Niibori just an alias?
uid01021c05.msg:003c:0x000028B2:00ac:8=Heh. Well, forgive me for not instantly trusting a stranger.
uid01021c05.msg:0051:0x000028EF:00b8:9=But, were you to join me, I'd gladly tell you my real name, at least in due time.
uid01021c05.msg:0005:0x00002941:00c4:10=What?
uid01021c05.msg:0049:0x00002947:00d0:11=You see, I've been scoping out the local dojos, looking for men of skill.
uid01021c05.msg:001c:0x00002991:00dc:12=What are you recruiting for?
uid01021c05.msg:0046:0x000029AE:00e8:13=Oh, I've been thinking about causing what you might call a disruption.
uid01021c05.msg:0069:0x000029F5:00f4:14=And due to the nature of the job, I only want the best on my team. You seem like you'd be perfect, so...?
uid01021c05.msg:003c:0x00002A5F:0100:15=I'm not interested in you or your job. Go find someone else.
uid01021c05.msg:0057:0x00002A9C:010c:16=You're no fun. But fine... I get it. Why don't I restart our conversation with a favor?
uid01021c05.msg:0004:0x00002AF4:0118:17=Huh?
uid01021c05.msg:0064:0x00002AF9:0124:18=That talent I spoke of—it's known far and wide in Choshu. I'm one of the best informants there is.
uid01021c05.msg:0026:0x00002B5E:0130:19=Okay. And why are you telling me this?
uid01021c05.msg:0064:0x00002B85:013c:20=To help you make actual progress. Using a mediocre informant will only get you mediocre information.
uid01021c05.msg:002a:0x00002BEA:0148:21=Well, I suppose that's all you can afford.
uid01021c05.msg:0052:0x00002C15:0154:22=But anyway, that guy people call the Crow? He's the most mediocre in the business.
uid01021c05.msg:0025:0x00002C68:0160:23=Then what are you saying I should do?
uid01021c05.msg:006e:0x00002C8E:016c:24=If you really want to find your Tennen Rishin user, I can introduce you to the best information broker in Kyo.
uid01021c05.msg:004c:0x00002D04:0184:25=I'm not asking anything in return. All I want is for us to be on good terms.
uid01021c05.msg:001a:0x00002D51:0190:26=Does that sweeten the pot?
uid01021c05.msg:0008:0x00002D6C:019c:27=...Sure.
uid01021c05.msg:005e:0x00002D75:01a8:28=Then without further ado, the guy I know lives in Purgatory, a place that's deep in the slums.
uid01021c05.msg:0023:0x00002DD4:01b4:29=He goes by "The Bathkeeper of Sai."
uid01021c05.msg:0011:0x00002DF8:01c0:30=The "Bathkeeper"?
uid01021c05.msg:004c:0x00002E0A:01cc:31=It's because he meets his clients at a bathhouse. Switches it up every time.
uid01021c05.msg:0006:0x00002E57:01d8:32=I see.
uid01021c05.msg:0055:0x00002E5E:01e4:33=Anyway, I'll ask him beforehand if he can look into this Tennen Rishin user of yours.
uid01021c05.msg:0055:0x00002EB4:01f0:34=Then, once the sun's gone down, make your way to the bathhouse in South Yashikimachi.
uid01021c05.msg:0047:0x00002F0A:01fc:35=Tell them you're Niibori Matsusuke, and they'll set you up with my guy.
uid01021c05.msg:0036:0x00002F52:0208:36=Your offer seems a bit too generous. What's the catch?
uid01021c05.msg:004c:0x00002F89:0214:37=My, aren't we suspicious... You don't have to trust me if you don't want to.
uid01021c05.msg:0060:0x00002FD6:0220:38=But even if I did have something up my sleeve, you'd still get more out of cooperating than not.
uid01021c05.msg:0062:0x00003037:022c:39=Just tell me this. If I go to the bathhouse in South Yashikimachi and say I'm Niibori Matsusuke...
uid01021c05.msg:0024:0x0000309A:0238:40=Only then can I meet this informant?
uid01021c05.msg:0035:0x000030BF:0244:41=Indeed. And there's some time yet before nightfall...
uid01021c05.msg:004a:0x000030F5:0250:42=So be wary of the Shinsengumi. But I probably don't have to tell you that.
uid01021c05.msg:0065:0x00003140:025c:43=Ever since the Bakufu put them in charge of peacekeeping, ronin like you have had anything but peace.
uid01021c05.msg:004c:0x000031A6:0268:44=Make one wrong move and you're dead. Sometimes you're dead even before that.
uid01021c05.msg:000f:0x000031F3:0274:45=I'm well aware.
uid01021c05.msg:002d:0x00003204:028c:46=Hold on. Don't you at least owe me your name?
uid01021c05.msg:0025:0x00003232:0298:47=I might have an alias, too, you know.
uid01021c05.msg:0021:0x00003258:02a4:48=Then I suppose it's a fair trade.
uid01021c05.msg:001d:0x0000327A:02b0:49=Heh. The name's Saito Hajime.
uid01021c05.msg:002f:0x00003298:02bc:50=Saito-san. I'll remember that... Be seeing you.
uid01021c05.msg:0014:0x000032C9:02d4:51=Niibori of Choshu...
uid01021c05.msg:0045:0x000032DE:02e0:52=You pretend to be an open book, but your story doesn't quite line up.
uid01021c05.msg:0053:0x00003325:02f8:53=(Can I really learn about Tennen Rishin from some bathhouse in South Yashikimachi?)
uid01021c05.msg:006d:0x00003379:0304:54=(I'm supposed to go there at night, so I've got some time to kill. Maybe I'll head back to Teradaya for now.)
uid01021c06.msg:004d:0x000029D9:0044:1=I'm sure Niibori told you this, but I'm seeking a man who uses Tennen Rishin.
uid01021c06.msg:0060:0x00002A27:0050:2=Uh-huh. Now, before we get into it, I want to know why you're after this guy in the first place.
uid01021c06.msg:0039:0x00002A88:005c:3=I prefer to keep that private. Even if it costs me extra.
uid01021c06.msg:0039:0x00002AC2:0068:4=A ronin like you should be glad you can afford me at all.
uid01021c06.msg:0031:0x00002AFC:0074:5=Of course, in this instance, it's not your money.
uid01021c06.msg:0018:0x00002B2E:0080:6=Niibori footed the bill?
uid01021c06.msg:000c:0x00002B47:008c:7=That he did.
uid01021c06.msg:0013:0x00002B54:0098:8=Who is he, exactly?
uid01021c06.msg:004b:0x00002B68:00a4:9=Niibori Matsusuke is a man from Choshu. That's really all you need to know.
uid01021c06.msg:0038:0x00002BB4:00b0:10=Really? Even though you're the one asking about motives?
uid01021c06.msg:007b:0x00002BED:00bc:11=I couldn't do this job if I wasn't a curious man. But, fair's fair. Forget about what I asked, it just sort of slipped out.
uid01021c06.msg:0018:0x00002C69:00c8:12=Why don't we start over?
uid01021c06.msg:003a:0x00002C82:00d4:13=Let's talk about the Tennen Rishin user. What do you know?
uid01021c06.msg:0079:0x00002CBD:00e0:14=Well, first things first... Tennen Rishin itself is a backwater style of swordfighting, taught only in the Shieikan dojo.
uid01021c06.msg:0056:0x00002D37:00ec:15=And roughly a year ago, a bunch of Shieikan guys left Edo and set up shop here in Kyo.
uid01021c06.msg:002a:0x00002D8E:00f8:16=But you probably knew all of that already.
uid01021c06.msg:0005:0x00002DB9:0104:17=Yeah.
uid01021c06.msg:0057:0x00002DBF:0110:18=Well, afterwards, those same guys who left the Shieikan founded a certain organization.
uid01021c06.msg:0017:0x00002E17:011c:19=A certain organization?
uid01021c06.msg:0090:0x00002E2F:0128:20=Their sole purpose is to maintain order in Kyo, with the Bakufu's backing. They do this primarily by arresting any loyalists they deem a threat.
uid01021c06.msg:0017:0x00002EC0:0134:21=Wait, you don't mean...
uid01021c06.msg:0039:0x00002ED8:0140:22=Yup. This organization's none other than the Shinsengumi.
uid01021c06.msg:0064:0x00002F12:014c:23=That rowdy Shieikan bunch are now in charge of a government-sanctioned, shishi-slaughtering brigade.
uid01021c06.msg:0065:0x00002F7E:0164:24=Let's start with the Shinsengumi chief, Kondo Isami. He's the fourth heir to the Tennen Rishin style.
uid01021c06.msg:003e:0x00002FE4:0170:25=He and six other masters make up the top Shinsengumi officers.
uid01021c06.msg:0093:0x00003023:017c:26=Deputy Chief Hijikata Toshizo, General Secretary Yamanami Keisuke, First Division Captain Okita Soji, Second Division Captain Nagakura Shinpachi...
uid01021c06.msg:0053:0x000030B7:0188:27=Sixth Division Captain Inoue Genzaburo, and Eighth Division Captain Todo Heisuke...
uid01021c06.msg:001d:0x0000310B:0194:28=Each one, a notorious killer.
uid01021c06.msg:0050:0x00003129:01a0:29=So if I heard you right, everyone who knows Tennen Rishin is in the Shinsengumi?
uid01021c06.msg:0056:0x0000317A:01ac:30=Correct. They were mocked for their "rube swordplay" at first, but that changed quick.
uid01021c06.msg:0042:0x000031D1:01b8:31=Word spread once they started massacring loyalists left and right.
uid01021c06.msg:003b:0x00003214:01c4:32=As of now, the Shinsengumi's roughly a thousand men strong.
uid01021c06.msg:004c:0x00003250:01d0:33=Bet they'd even give the armies of the Sengoku period a run for their money.
uid01021c06.msg:0049:0x000032A0:0200:34=Those officers you mentioned... Did any of them travel to Tosa last year?
uid01021c06.msg:002e:0x000032EA:020c:35=Huh? Now why would I know something like that?
uid01021c06.msg:0031:0x00003319:0218:36=Can't imagine anyone would know, for that matter.
uid01021c06.msg:0061:0x0000334B:0224:37=One would have to get extremely close with the Shinsengumi to pry that deep. And that takes time.
uid01021c06.msg:0006:0x000033AD:0230:38=I see.
uid01021c06.msg:0063:0x000033B4:023c:39=But clearly, you're looking for a specific Tennen Rishin user who happened to be in Tosa last year.
uid01021c06.msg:0038:0x00003418:0248:40=I can find out who, but it'll cost you an arm and a leg.
uid01021c06.msg:004c:0x00003452:0260:41=No, it's clear the man I seek is in the Shinsengumi. I can go on that alone.
uid01021c06.msg:001a:0x0000349F:026c:42=Oh yeah? What's your plan?
uid01021c06.msg:0033:0x000034C1:0284:43=Whoa, hey, mister! This bath is reserved right now!
uid01021c06.msg:0004:0x000034F5:0290:44=Oof!
uid01021c06.msg:000e:0x000034FA:029c:45=What was that?
uid01021c06.msg:0012:0x00003509:02a8:46=Heck, you tell me.
uid01021c06.msg:0016:0x00003522:02fc:47=A warm welcome to you.
uid01021c06.msg:001d:0x00003539:0308:48=The name's Niibori Matsusuke.
uid01021c06.msg:0026:0x00003557:0314:49=Ah. Pleased to make your acquaintance.
uid01021c06.msg:002d:0x0000357E:0320:50=We hope you enjoy your visit, Mister Niibori.
uid01021c06.msg:0027:0x000035B3:0338:51=The bath is just ahead. Right this way.
uid01021c0d.msg:000c:0x00001C7D:0034:1=Urp... Ahhh!
uid01021c0d.msg:0027:0x00001C8A:0040:2=You know, you're surprisingly generous.
uid01021c0d.msg:0030:0x00001CB2:004c:3=Heh, speakin' of, I hardly ever treat other men.
uid01021c0d.msg:0034:0x00001CE3:0058:4=Crazy, eh? Must mean I've taken a real likin' to ya!
uid01021c0d.msg:0017:0x00001D20:007c:5=So, where ya hail from?
uid01021c0d.msg:0032:0x00001D38:0088:6=I'm not nearly drunk enough to talk about my past.
uid01021c0d.msg:0026:0x00001D6B:0094:7=Bullcrap. Yer drinkin' more than I am!
uid01021c0d.msg:003c:0x00001D9A:00b8:8=Okay. At least say what you were buyin' from the Bathkeeper.
uid01021c0d.msg:001e:0x00001DD7:00c4:9=You don't need me to tell you.
uid01021c0d.msg:003c:0x00001DF6:00d0:10=After all, you were there to hire him yourself, weren't you?
uid01021c0d.msg:0041:0x00001E33:00dc:11=Yeah... If it wasn't fer your ass showin' up, I'da had my chance.
uid01021c0d.msg:005b:0x00001E75:00e8:12=Alright! I'll tell you what I wanted if you tell me what you wanted. How's that for a deal?
uid01021c0d.msg:001d:0x00001ED1:00f4:13=Sorry, but I'll have to pass.
uid01021c0d.msg:0039:0x00001EEF:0100:14=Gahah! Fine, be that way! At least I got nothin' to hide.
uid01021c0d.msg:0051:0x00001F29:010c:15=Here's what I wanted: to look into the Shinsengumi chief. Kondo Isami's the name.
uid01021c0d.msg:000b:0x00001F7B:0118:16=Come again?
uid01021c0d.msg:0048:0x00001F87:0124:17=The guy's a real shit-eater, too. Got a shit-eating grin and everything.
uid01021c0d.msg:003f:0x00001FD0:0130:18=The reason I was pissed at the bathhouse was all 'cause of him.
uid01021c0d.msg:0021:0x00002010:013c:19=You've met him, this Kondo Isami?
uid01021c0d.msg:003f:0x00002032:0148:20=Yeah, I met him. Coupla hours before our li'l workout, in fact.
uid01021c0d.msg:0042:0x00002072:0154:21=Y'know he used to be a damn peasant? Not exactly samurai material.
uid01021c0d.msg:0052:0x000020B5:0160:22=But even before the guy's balls dropped, he'd been trainin' in some kinda style...
uid01021c0d.msg:0018:0x00002108:016c:23=The Tennen Rishin style.
uid01021c0d.msg:005a:0x00002121:0178:24=Yeah, that was it! Gotta say, for a shit-eating wannabe samurai, he was also real intense.
uid01021c0d.msg:0067:0x0000217C:0184:25=Heh, what a day it's been. First I meet Kondo, then you... Guess I attract the strongest of the strong.
uid01021c0d.msg:002f:0x000021E4:0190:26=By the way, how'd you get a meeting with Kondo?
uid01021c0d.msg:001c:0x00002214:019c:27=What? You wanna see 'im too?
uid01021c0d.msg:005f:0x00002238:01b4:28=We're talkin' about the leader of a pack of killers. You don't just schedule tea with that guy.
uid01021c0d.msg:0032:0x00002298:01c0:29=All the same, I imagine there's some way to do it.
uid01021c0d.msg:0008:0x000022CB:01cc:30=Such as?
uid01021c0d.msg:004e:0x000022D4:01d8:31=Ya could always force yer way into the Shinsengumi barracks. Or if not that...
uid01021c0d.msg:0024:0x00002323:01e4:32=I can join the Shinsengumi outright.
uid01021c0d.msg:000d:0x00002348:01f0:33=Heh. Or that.
uid01021c0d.msg:001e:0x00002356:01fc:34=What route did you take, then?
uid01021c0d.msg:0030:0x00002375:0208:35=Heh, in my case, I wasn't out lookin' for Kondo.
uid01021c0d.msg:001e:0x000023A6:0214:36=He was the one lookin' for me.
uid01021c13.msg:001e:0x000016B9:0044:1=(What's all the commotion...?)

uid01021c13.msg:001c:0x0000171C:0080:4=Did the Shinsengumi do this?
uid01021c13.msg:001f:0x00001739:008c:5=If they did, they'll be nearby.

uid01021c13.msg:004a:0x00001765:00d4:7=By gum, it <i>is</i> you! Well, I'll be! It's me, Shimada Yahei from Tosa!
uid01021c13.msg:002a:0x000017B0:00e0:8=Fancy meeting you all the way here in Kyo!
uid01021c13.msg:0068:0x000017E6:0128:9=Shimada Yahei had a loose tongue, sorry to say. He needed to be silenced before he created any problems.
uid01021c13.msg:0028:0x0000184F:0134:10=Are you the one who killed him? Tell me.
uid01021c13.msg:002f:0x00001878:0140:11=Heh. Don't mistake me as your enemy, Ryoma-san.
uid01021c13.msg:0052:0x000018AA:0164:12=There's no need to cause a commotion. Why don't we settle this later at Mukurogai?
uid01021c13.msg:000a:0x000018FD:0170:13=Mukurogai?
uid01021c13.msg:0032:0x00001908:017c:14=You can ask your friends at Teradaya all about it.
uid01021c13.msg:0019:0x0000193B:0188:15=What do you want from me?
uid01021c13.msg:002c:0x00001955:0194:16=You'll find out when you come—if you come.
uid01021c13.msg:0022:0x00001984:01b8:17=(That strange man knew my name...)
uid01021c13.msg:0025:0x000019A7:01c4:18=(And he wants me to go to Mukurogai?)
uid01021c13.msg:002c:0x000019CD:01d0:19=(I should ask about this place at Teradaya.)
uid01021c13.msg:0029:0x000019FD:0200:20=(I should go back to Teradaya and sleep.)
uid01021c1c.msg:0044:0x00000D9F:004c:1=Well, look who the cat dragged in. You're back rather early tonight.
uid01021c1c.msg:0016:0x00000DE4:0058:2=Heh, whatever you say.
uid01021c1c.msg:002c:0x00000DFB:0064:3=By the way, Oryo. How do I get to Mukurogai?
uid01021c1c.msg:0030:0x00000E28:0070:4=Mukurogai? You don't go there, you end up there.
uid01021c1c.msg:0014:0x00000E59:007c:5=End up how, exactly?
uid01021c1c.msg:004a:0x00000E6E:0088:6=That place is a desecrated slum not even government officials set foot in.
uid01021c1c.msg:0029:0x00000EB9:0094:7=Only criminals and vagrants call it home.
uid01021c1c.msg:0051:0x00000EE3:00a0:8=I've heard it's got corpses piled about, with pickpockets rummaging through them!
uid01021c1c.msg:002e:0x00000F35:00ac:9=Could you take me to it? Or at least close by?
uid01021c1c.msg:0062:0x00000F64:00b8:10=Did you not hear a word I said? No one in their right mind would want to go there, for any reason!
uid01021c1c.msg:002b:0x00000FC9:00dc:11=I'll do it, Oryo-chan. You leave him to me.
uid01021c1c.msg:005d:0x00000FF5:00e8:12=I'll simply watch from afar. Should trouble start brewing, I'll paddle like a bat outta hell.
uid01021c1c.msg:0013:0x00001053:00f4:13=Anything will help.
uid01021c1c.msg:0023:0x00001067:0100:14=Fine. I'll pretend I heard nothing.
uid01021c22.msg:001b:0x00000F0A:0050:1=Sorry to drag you out here.
uid01021c22.msg:001d:0x00000F26:005c:2=You got any plan to get back?
uid01021c22.msg:0025:0x00000F44:0068:3=Not yet. But you can head back first.
uid01021c22.msg:0007:0x00000F6A:0074:4=Got it.
uid01021c22.msg:0032:0x00000F76:00b0:5=Say, mister, what do you need in Mukurogai anyway?
uid01021c22.msg:0024:0x00000FA9:00bc:6=Let's just say I've been invited in.
uid01021c22.msg:0049:0x00000FCE:00c8:7=Invited in? Well now, sounds like staying at a distance won't work, then.
uid01021c22.msg:002c:0x00001018:00d4:8=Right. There's someone I need to meet there.
uid01021c22.msg:002c:0x00001045:00e0:9=Hah, I had a feeling this might be the case.
uid01021c22.msg:003f:0x00001072:00ec:10=Listen, fella. Care to know why this place is called Mukurogai?
uid01021c22.msg:005e:0x000010B9:0104:11=Its real name is Rokumoncho. A long time ago, it boasted the biggest temple in all of Rakugai.
uid01021c22.msg:0069:0x00001118:0110:12=A famous monk resided there. He took in runaways and people with incurable diseases... Society's rejects.
uid01021c22.msg:006d:0x00001182:011c:13=But eventually, a plague swept through the temple, and all who lived there died. They had to be buried quick.
uid01021c22.msg:0045:0x000011F0:0128:14=So if you dig around there, you'll find enough bones to fill a crypt.
uid01021c22.msg:0048:0x00001236:0134:15=That's why now, everyone knows it as Mukurogai—the Dead Man's Quarter.
uid01021c22.msg:0031:0x0000127F:0140:16=These days, it's nothing but a haunt for outlaws.
uid01021c22.msg:0027:0x000012B1:014c:17=As such, I suggest you don't stay long.
uid01021c22.msg:001f:0x000012D9:0158:18=Look sharp, it's just up ahead.
uid01021c27.msg:002e:0x00002115:0054:1=...Heh. I daresay you fight like a killer now.
uid01021c27.msg:0044:0x00002144:0060:2=Makes me wonder if you've taken any lives after leaving Tosa behind.
uid01021c27.msg:0014:0x00002189:006c:3=Who can tell, right?
uid01021c27.msg:0004:0x0000219E:0078:4=Heh.
uid01021c27.msg:0016:0x000021A3:0084:5=So what is this about?
uid01021c27.msg:0037:0x000021BA:0090:6=I just wanted to see for myself how much you'd changed.
uid01021c27.msg:0055:0x000021F2:009c:7=Also, I can't bring someone right to Takechi-sensei if he hasn't been seen in a year.
uid01021c27.msg:001d:0x00002248:00a8:8=Forgive me—simple protocol.
uid01021c27.msg:002c:0x00002266:00b4:9=So Brother's here with you in Kyo after all?
uid01021c27.msg:005e:0x00002293:00c0:10=Yes, and at the moment, those Shinsengumi vermin are after his head. So, we've been in hiding.
uid01021c27.msg:0016:0x000022F2:00cc:11=Where is he right now?
uid01021c27.msg:0032:0x00002309:00d8:12=Waiting for you, deep within the Mukurogai sprawl.
uid01021c27.msg:001f:0x0000233C:00e4:13=You're not gonna lead me there?
uid01021c27.msg:0039:0x0000235C:00f0:14=Hmm... I think not. I still can't stand the sight of you.
uid01021c27.msg:000f:0x00002396:00fc:15=Hmph, so be it.
uid01021c27.msg:002e:0x000023A9:012c:16=(Brother... So you really are here somewhere.)
uid01021c27.msg:0059:0x000023D8:0138:17=(But to think a place like this exists within the city... Wonder what else lurks inside.)
uid01021c27.msg:001a:0x00002435:0168:18=Welcome to hell, stranger.
uid01021c27.msg:004c:0x00002450:0174:19=Give us your money and we'll spare your life. The swords on your waist, too.
uid01021c27.msg:0042:0x0000249D:0180:20=My name is Sakamoto Ryoma. A man in a straw hat said he'd meet me.
uid01021c27.msg:001d:0x000024E0:018c:21=Indeed, this man is my guest.
uid01021c27.msg:0020:0x00002500:01b0:22=I'll be damned. So it was you...
uid01021c27.msg:0004:0x00002521:01bc:23=Izo.
uid01021c27.msg:002a:0x00002526:01c8:24=Does that mean my brother is here as well?
uid01021c27.msg:000d:0x00002551:01d4:25=Who can tell?
uid01021c27.msg:0005:0x00002560:01ec:26=Izo!?
uid01021c27.msg:0060:0x00002566:01f8:27=It's been a while, Rep. I confess I'm not the same fighter I was a year ago... as you shall see.
uid01021c27.msg:0024:0x000025D1:027c:28=Take this! Ya damn cheating bastard!
uid01021c32.msg:0036:0x0000218D:0034:1=Drink up, Ryoma. How long has it been since we talked?
uid01021c32.msg:0045:0x000021C5:004c:2=Being that you're here in Kyo, I'm guessing you committed dappan too?
uid01021c32.msg:004c:0x00002212:0064:3=What happened back home after Pops died? I can't imagine Tosa without him...
uid01021c32.msg:004a:0x00002261:0088:4=For starters, I never renounced Tosa. As a matter of fact, I got promoted.
uid01021c32.msg:0009:0x000022AC:0094:5=Promoted?
uid01021c32.msg:0064:0x000022B6:00a0:6=Yeah. You're looking at Tosa's official representative in Kyo. I even went from high goshi to joshi.
uid01021c32.msg:0023:0x0000231B:00ac:7=You're serious? You're a joshi now?
uid01021c32.msg:0059:0x0000233F:00b8:8=All thanks to you, since you saved my life that night. I understand it came at a price...
uid01021c32.msg:0062:0x00002399:00c4:9=But the Loyalist Party survived, and to help it flourish... I made allies with the elders of Tosa.
uid01021c32.msg:005c:0x000023FC:00d0:10=You what? You're telling me you joined hands with those who might've authored Pops's death!?
uid01021c32.msg:0021:0x0000245A:00e8:11=Yes. That's precisely what I did.
uid01021c32.msg:0036:0x00002483:0100:12=Listen well, Ryoma. Tosa is far from our only concern.
uid01021c32.msg:008d:0x000024BA:010c:13=In my eyes, Japan as a whole needs to change. It's not just Tosa we need to conquer, but rather the Bakufu above them who control the system.
uid01021c32.msg:0021:0x00002548:0118:14=You want to "conquer" the Bakufu?
uid01021c32.msg:0046:0x0000256A:0124:15=I do. It's the endgame of what Pops and I had been planning all along.
uid01021c32.msg:004b:0x000025B1:0130:16=And if it means a temporary alliance with some doddering old men, so be it.
uid01021c32.msg:0055:0x00002604:0148:17=Ryoma. In order for progress to happen, it needs to happen around the Emperor in Kyo.
uid01021c32.msg:00a1:0x0000265A:0154:18=Every loyalist worth his salt is gathering here from around the nation. We'll become a fighting force that can crush the Bakufu and restore the Emperor to power.
uid01021c32.msg:0021:0x000026FC:0160:19=That's what it means to be loyal.
uid01021c32.msg:0046:0x0000271E:016c:20=You really think it's possible to crush the Bakufu with numbers alone?
uid01021c32.msg:003d:0x00002765:0178:21=Yes, and I'm not the only one. Pops thought the same as well.
uid01021c32.msg:003e:0x000027A3:0184:22=The 300-year tyranny of Tokugawa rule is beginning to crumble.
uid01021c32.msg:0065:0x000027E2:0190:23=The Black Ships shook our hearts but stirred our spirits. They showed us even tyrants can be subdued!
uid01021c32.msg:0066:0x0000284F:01a8:24=Know this, Ryoma. A plan to oust the Bakufu is working its way through the Imperial Court as we speak.
uid01021c32.msg:0037:0x000028B6:01b4:25=Heh. My role in that is why I'm on the run for my life.
uid01021c32.msg:0032:0x000028EE:01c0:26=So that's how you ended up in a place like this...
uid01021c32.msg:004b:0x00002921:01cc:27=Pretty much. But enough about me... What have you been doing all this time?
uid01021c32.msg:0042:0x0000296D:01d8:28=Well... I'm still looking for Pops's killer—the man in the mask.
uid01021c32.msg:0037:0x000029B0:01e4:29=At first, my only clue was the way he fought back then.
uid01021c32.msg:005e:0x000029E8:01f0:30=It was clear he was a master swordsman, yet he didn't belong to any of the well-known schools.
uid01021c32.msg:0031:0x00002A47:01fc:31=But then I discovered... the Tennen Rishin style.
uid01021c32.msg:000e:0x00002A79:0208:32=Tennen Rishin?
uid01021c32.msg:0064:0x00002A88:0214:33=It's only been taught in a dojo called Shieikan, way out in Edo. There are only a few practitioners.
uid01021c32.msg:004d:0x00002AED:0220:34=But yesterday, I learned where those precious few practitioners are gathered.
uid01021c32.msg:0014:0x00002B3B:022c:35=Where would that be?
uid01021c32.msg:005c:0x00002B50:0238:36=In the Shinsengumi. And their chief, Kondo Isami—he's the heir to the Tennen Rishin style.
uid01021c32.msg:005b:0x00002BAD:0244:37=The Shinsengumi!? Are you saying Kondo Isami himself came to Tosa just to take Pops's life?
uid01021c32.msg:0059:0x00002C09:0250:38=No... There's more to Tennen Rishin than just Kondo. Several of his captains also use it.
uid01021c32.msg:003a:0x00002C63:025c:39=As far as I know, the masked man could be any one of them.
uid01021c32.msg:0017:0x00002C9E:0268:40=That's disconcerting...
uid01021c32.msg:005e:0x00002CB6:0274:41=Be that as it may... I'm tired of guessing around. So I'm joining the Shinsengumi to find him.
uid01021c36.msg:0005:0x00002225:0034:1=Huh!?
uid01021c36.msg:0019:0x0000222B:0040:2=Have you lost your mind!?
uid01021c36.msg:004e:0x0000224C:0058:3=What's gotten into you, hollering like that? You're gonna frighten the guests.
uid01021c36.msg:0058:0x0000229B:0064:4=Okami-san, you won't believe this! Hajime-san is saying he's gonna join the Shinsengumi!
uid01021c36.msg:0013:0x000022F4:0070:5=What? Is this true?
uid01021c36.msg:0004:0x00002308:007c:6=Yes.
uid01021c36.msg:001f:0x0000230D:0088:7=You <i>have</i> lost your mind.
uid01021c36.msg:0008:0x0000232D:0094:8=Told ya.
uid01021c36.msg:0043:0x0000233D:00ac:9=You've been idly roaming the town, now suddenly you want to enlist?
uid01021c36.msg:002d:0x00002381:00b8:10=I heard the Shinsengumi pay well, that's all.
uid01021c36.msg:0049:0x000023AF:00c4:11=And apparently just mentioning you're a member comes with a lot of perks.
uid01021c36.msg:0025:0x000023F9:00d0:12=Oh, I've heard all about <i>that</i>.
uid01021c36.msg:0090:0x0000241F:00dc:13=Besides, they're more or less ronin themselves, so they won't ask about my status as long as I have skill. Then I can finally start paying rent.
uid01021c36.msg:005f:0x000024B0:00e8:14=Are ya dense? Your solution to pay for room and board is to kill people? To become a Mibu Wolf?
uid01021c36.msg:000f:0x00002510:00f4:15=...A Mibu Wolf?
uid01021c36.msg:007d:0x00002520:0100:16=That's what people call the Shinsengumi. Back in the day, they caused total chaos while calling themselves the Miburoshigumi.
uid01021c36.msg:0010:0x0000259E:010c:17=Miburoshigumi...
uid01021c36.msg:0046:0x000025AF:0118:18="The vicious wolves of Mibu devour their own." Or so people would say.
uid01021c36.msg:0014:0x000025F6:0124:19=Why'd they say that?
uid01021c36.msg:006c:0x0000260B:0130:20=You're joining and you didn't even know? When the Miburoshigumi was founded, they initially had two leaders.
uid01021c36.msg:0047:0x00002678:013c:21=One is the current chief, Kondo Isami. And the other was Serizawa Kamo.
uid01021c36.msg:0043:0x000026C0:0148:22=Rumor has it that Serizawa-san was killed by Kondo and his faction.
uid01021c36.msg:001f:0x00002704:0154:23=So even they have infighting...
uid01021c36.msg:0047:0x00002724:0160:24=Kondo and Serizawa were always arguing over who should have more power.
uid01021c36.msg:006f:0x0000276C:016c:25=Eventually, Kondo-san got fed up and killed Serizawa and his followers... Tore them to shreds, is what I heard.
uid01021c36.msg:001e:0x000027DC:0178:26=It's a gruesome story, really.
uid01021c36.msg:0038:0x000027FB:0184:27=Well, you've made your point about them being dangerous.
uid01021c36.msg:0032:0x00002834:0190:28=They're rabid wolves with swords instead of fangs.
uid01021c36.msg:005d:0x00002867:019c:29=Hajime-san, I hate to say it, but... A careless man like you will get devoured in an instant.
uid01021c36.msg:003b:0x000028C5:01a8:30=Yeah, getting caught up with them will only bring bad news.
uid01021c36.msg:0036:0x00002901:01b4:31=So they're wolves, huh? Clearly you two don't approve.
uid01021c36.msg:007e:0x00002938:01c0:32=Did you ever consider the fact that if people find a Shinsengumi member at my inn, I'll lose customers and go out of business?
uid01021c36.msg:002d:0x000029B7:01cc:33=Besides, do you even know how to use a sword?
uid01021c36.msg:0042:0x000029E5:01d8:34=Well, I'm not the worst swordsman in the world... Anyway, I'm off.
uid01021c36.msg:0010:0x00002A29:01f0:35=Hey, Hajime-san!
uid01021c36.msg:005f:0x00002A3A:01fc:36=It's great that you're finally getting work, but couldn't you have found something more normal?
uid01021c36.msg:004a:0x00002A9A:0208:37=Sorry, but my mind's made up. I'll make sure not to cause you any trouble.
uid01021c36.msg:000d:0x00002AE5:0214:38=Hajime-san...
uid01021c36.msg:0027:0x00002AF3:0220:39=That's all I have to say on the matter.
uid01021c36.msg:0035:0x00002B1C:0238:40=Who knew the man could be so stubborn? That Hajime...
uid01021c36.msg:004d:0x00002B5D:0280:41=(If I remember correctly, the Shinsengumi barracks are west of Shijo Street.)
uid01021c36.msg:0032:0x00002BAB:028c:42=(I suppose I should make my way to Rakunai first.)
uid01021c43.msg:0015:0x00000C61:004c:1=So this is the place.
uid01021c43.msg:0015:0x00000C79:0070:2=What brings you here?
uid01021c43.msg:0013:0x00000C8F:007c:3=I'm here to enlist.
uid01021c43.msg:0035:0x00000CA3:0088:4=Are you now... Well, you're certainly welcome to try.
uid01021c43.msg:0057:0x00000CD9:0094:5=In fact, we're holding tryouts just around the corner. You can proceed if you're ready.
uid01021c43.msg:0037:0x00000D32:00ac:6=Oh, right. Before I forget, please state your hometown.
uid01021c43.msg:0045:0x00000D6A:00b8:7=I thought you guys only cared about skill, not where people are from.
uid01021c43.msg:004d:0x00000DB0:00c4:8=And you thought right. I'm only asking so we'll know where to send your body.
uid01021c43.msg:000a:0x00000DFE:00d0:9=Excuse me?
uid01021c43.msg:005c:0x00000E09:00dc:10=Our tryouts aren't for the faint of heart. One wrong move and you can easily lose your life.
uid01021c43.msg:0057:0x00000E66:00e8:11=That may be... But I don't plan on dying here. So save your questions for the next man.
uid01021c43.msg:0028:0x00000EBE:00f4:12=Heh, very well. Forgive my indiscretion.
uid01021c48.msg:0022:0x00001A22:0040:1=I'll admit, ya swing a mean sword.
uid01021c48.msg:0059:0x00001A45:004c:2=You're not bad yourself. But our match hasn't yet been decided. Should we get back to it?
uid01021c48.msg:0061:0x00001A9F:0058:3=Hmph. Nah, moment's over. Pullin' out really sucks, so we'll start fresh another time. 'Til then!
uid01021c48.msg:0031:0x00001B02:0070:4=Well, now ya've met our mad dog. Sorry 'bout him.
uid01021c48.msg:004e:0x00001B34:007c:5=Not a problem. If I'm being honest, I wish he'd have finished what he started.
uid01021c48.msg:006e:0x00001B83:0088:6=Heh. Unlike me, he ain't the brute strength type. He's all about pure speed. Didn't ya see that in his Rishin?
uid01021c48.msg:0051:0x00001BF2:0094:7=I was too busy staying on my toes than observing. But, now that you mention it...
uid01021c48.msg:000a:0x00001C46:00b8:8=What's up?
uid01021c48.msg:0036:0x00001C52:00d0:9=Oh, I just thought I had a good chance at beating him.
uid01021c48.msg:0024:0x00001C89:00dc:10=Heh, wouldn't be so sure about that.
uid01021c48.msg:0004:0x00001CAE:00e8:11=Why?
uid01021c48.msg:0067:0x00001CB3:00f4:12=He wasn't even takin' ya seriously. If he had, you'd be breathin' through a hole in yer neck right now.
uid01021c48.msg:0016:0x00001D1B:0100:13=...Just like Kamo-san.
uid01021c48.msg:0009:0x00001D32:010c:14=Kamo-san?
uid01021c48.msg:0035:0x00001D3C:0118:15=Yeah, the other chief we had. Serizawa-san, that was.
uid01021c48.msg:0033:0x00001D72:0124:16=Serizawa Kamo? I heard his own comrades did him in.
uid01021c48.msg:002a:0x00001DA6:0130:17=Are you saying Okita was involved in that?
uid01021c48.msg:004a:0x00001DD1:013c:18=Could be. But that's none of yer concern... Shouldn'ta even brought it up.
uid01021c48.msg:0046:0x00001E23:0154:19=Anyway, Okita Soji's captain of the First Division, if ya didn't know.
uid01021c48.msg:0039:0x00001E6A:0160:20=From the look of it, I think he's takin' a shining to ya.
uid01021c48.msg:0022:0x00001EA4:016c:21=Heh. Should I be happy about that?
uid01021c48.msg:0068:0x00001EC7:0178:22=Hell no. When he sees a skilled fighter, he starts wantin' to smear his coat red with the guy's blood...
uid01021c48.msg:0021:0x00001F30:0184:23=Even if they're on the same team.
uid01021c48.msg:0019:0x00001F53:019c:24=So that was Okita Soji...
uid01021c48.msg:0038:0x00001F6E:01b4:25=You're Saito, the one who just finished a tryout, right?
uid01021c48.msg:000d:0x00001FA7:01c0:26=That's right.
uid01021c48.msg:0034:0x00001FB5:01cc:27=I got a message from the deputy chief. Come with me.
uid01021c48.msg:000f:0x00001FEA:01d8:28=What's he want?
uid01021c48.msg:001e:0x00001FFA:01e4:29=Your attendance. Now be quick.
uid01021c4d.msg:0045:0x00000280:0038:1=(It's evening. I should head to Tsubakiro where the Deputy Chief is.)
uid01021c4d.msg:001a:0x000002C7:0050:2=You may now use your room.
uid01021c4d.msg:0030:0x000002E2:005c:3=You will regain health when you enter your room.
uid01021c4d.msg:0026:0x00000313:0068:4=You can access your storage from here.
uid01021c54.msg:002f:0x00000285:0044:1=(This is the ryotei that Hijikata mentioned...)
uid01021c54.msg:0020:0x000002B5:0050:2=(Maybe I can come back later...)
uid01021c54.msg:0016:0x000002D6:005c:3=(All right, let's go.)
uid01021c57.msg:0049:0x000000F0:0028:1=(He said Tsubakiro is in Gion, and Gion's on the east of Shijo Street...)
uid01021c58.msg:0019:0x00003873:005c:1=Same shit, different day.
uid01021c58.msg:0031:0x0000388D:0068:2=Including the part where Chief Kondo never shows?
uid01021c58.msg:0004:0x000038BF:0074:3=Yup.
uid01021c58.msg:005a:0x000038C4:0080:4=Like Ito said, he probably kicked the bucket however long ago. Can't say I'd be surprised.
uid01021c58.msg:0009:0x0000391F:008c:5=Really...
uid01021c58.msg:005b:0x0000392A:00a4:6=(Okay, I need to focus here. The man who killed Pops is a user of the Tennen Rishin style.)
uid01021c58.msg:004f:0x00003986:00b0:7=(I doubt it was Yamanami. He was skilled but nothing like the man in the mask.)
uid01021c58.msg:003b:0x000039D6:00bc:8=(And I know that unlike Okita, he wasn't going easy on me.)
uid01021c58.msg:004b:0x00003A12:00c8:9=(So with Yamanami out of the picture, only six Tennen Rishin users remain.)
uid01021c58.msg:0031:0x00003A5F:00e0:10=(Todo Heisuke, Captain of the Eighth Division...)
uid01021c58.msg:0033:0x00003A91:00ec:11=(Inoue Genzaburo, Captain of the Sixth Division...)
uid01021c58.msg:0037:0x00003AC5:00f8:12=(Nagakura Shinpachi, Captain of the Second Division...)
uid01021c58.msg:002e:0x00003AFD:0104:13=(Okita Soji, Captain of the First Division...)
uid01021c58.msg:0043:0x00003B2C:0110:14=(Hijikata Toshizo, Deputy Chief of the Shinsengumi. And finally...)
uid01021c58.msg:004d:0x00003B70:011c:15=(Kondo Isami, Chief of the Shinsengumi and heir to the Tennen Rishin itself.)
uid01021c58.msg:002b:0x00003BBF:0134:16=...It seems I have a long road ahead of me.
uid01021c58.msg:0017:0x00003BEF:0170:17=Where's the chief, sir?
uid01021c58.msg:0035:0x00003C08:0188:18=Chief Kondo currently has other matters to attend to.
uid01021c58.msg:0013:0x00003C3E:0194:19=Skipping out again?
uid01021c58.msg:0049:0x00003C52:01a0:20=The Shinsengumi's a famous organization with members a thousand strong...
uid01021c58.msg:0050:0x00003C9C:01ac:21=And yet our leader never bothers showing his face? Disrespectful, if you ask me.
uid01021c58.msg:0041:0x00003CEE:01c4:22=I see no issue in relaying the chief's directives as I have been.
uid01021c58.msg:0057:0x00003D30:01d0:23=I also recognize how well we've been operating. Yet somehow you see a problem, Ito-san?
uid01021c58.msg:0027:0x00003D88:01dc:24=We might be okay for now, Hijikata-san.
uid01021c58.msg:0060:0x00003DB0:01e8:25=But it's safe to assume we've got some tough battles ahead of us. Battles that require strategy.
uid01021c58.msg:006d:0x00003E11:01f4:26=As the advisor of this whole operation, I'd rather have a leader around to guide us when shit comes to shove.
uid01021c58.msg:003f:0x00003E7F:0200:27=Here's my idea. How 'bout we just get someone else to be chief?
uid01021c58.msg:001e:0x00003EC7:0224:28=Care to elaborate, Suzuki-kun?
uid01021c58.msg:006b:0x00003EE6:0230:29=No matter how smooth things are runnin', a real leader sets the example. We need someone we can look up to.
uid01021c58.msg:004c:0x00003F52:023c:30=If he's not gonna fight on the frontlines, are we supposed to do it for him?
uid01021c58.msg:002d:0x00003F9F:0248:31=In the Shinsengumi, doesn't might make right?
uid01021c58.msg:0069:0x00003FCD:0254:32=So in my humble opinion, our chief's gotta show his might. There's gotta be someone here who can do that.
uid01021c58.msg:0047:0x00004037:0260:33=This person you speak of, that wouldn't happen to be Ito-san, would it?
uid01021c58.msg:001f:0x0000407F:026c:34=Well, I never said <i>that</i>.
uid01021c58.msg:0036:0x0000409F:0278:35=Really? That's what it sounded like you were implying.
uid01021c58.msg:0034:0x000040D6:0284:36=I'm well aware how indebted you feel toward Ito-san.
uid01021c58.msg:005e:0x0000410B:0290:37=That's only natural, since you owe your captainhood to him. But you need to control your bias.
uid01021c58.msg:0015:0x0000416A:029c:38=Alright. Point taken.
uid01021c58.msg:005b:0x00004180:02a8:39=The Shinsengumi will operate with Chief Kondo at the center. It always has, it always will.
uid01021c58.msg:0036:0x000041DC:02b4:40=As for your concerns, Advisor Ito-san, lay them aside.
uid01021c58.msg:0054:0x00004213:02c0:41=I can do that. Oh, and please tell the chief I hope he's happy and in good health...
uid01021c58.msg:0028:0x00004268:02cc:42=That is, if he really is still among us.
uid01021c58.msg:001c:0x00004293:02f0:43=...What do you mean by that?
uid01021c58.msg:0079:0x000042B0:02fc:44=Ah, well, a little rumor's been spreading. Perhaps we oughta just "lay it aside," but... some say the chief is long dead.
uid01021c58.msg:001e:0x0000432A:0308:45=Nothing more than idle gossip.
uid01021c58.msg:002a:0x00004349:0314:46=Of course it is. I'm right there with you.
uid01021c58.msg:003e:0x00004374:0320:47=But you can hardly be surprised such a rumor like this exists.
uid01021c58.msg:0046:0x000043B3:032c:48=In all honesty, how many people have even seen Chief Kondo these days?
uid01021c58.msg:0044:0x000043FA:0338:49=Why, I've only seen him once since I joined up, and I'm the advisor.
uid01021c58.msg:006f:0x0000443F:0344:50=Just think of the idea of you, Hijikata-san, using his absence to steer the Shinsengumi for your own benefit...
uid01021c58.msg:005d:0x000044AF:0350:51=There are actually people out there making crazy accusations like that. Preposterous, I know.
uid01021c58.msg:004f:0x0000450D:035c:52=But I guess it comes with the territory. Don't let it bother you, Deputy Chief.
uid01021c58.msg:000a:0x0000455D:0368:53=...Indeed.
uid01021c58.msg:002d:0x00004568:0374:54=How long're you sad sacks gonna keep yappin'?
uid01021c58.msg:0011:0x00004598:0398:55=Late again, Soji?
uid01021c58.msg:0050:0x000045AA:03a4:56=I was gettin' in some beauty sleep, alright? This meeting's a snoozefest anyway.
uid01021c58.msg:0059:0x000045FB:03b0:57=Speakin' of, where's that sourpuss rookie we hired? Got some nerve being late on day one!
uid01021c58.msg:001e:0x00004655:03bc:58=He'll be arriving soon enough.
uid01021c66.msg:000a:0x00000B58:0028:1=Saito-san.
uid01021c66.msg:000f:0x00000B63:0034:2=And you were...
uid01021c66.msg:0013:0x00000B73:0040:3=Todo. Todo Heisuke.
uid01021c66.msg:0033:0x00000B89:0064:4=I thought my job would be explained to me tomorrow.
uid01021c66.msg:0022:0x00000BBD:0070:5=This is something different. Here.
uid01021c66.msg:000d:0x00000BE0:007c:6=What is this?
uid01021c66.msg:0063:0x00000BEE:0088:7=A sky-blue Shinsengumi haori. Only captains are allowed to wear it, so take a moment to feel proud.
uid01021c66.msg:0052:0x00000C52:0094:8=Have it on tomorrow when you come in. As a leader, you have to look the part, too.
uid01021c66.msg:000d:0x00000CA5:00a0:9=See you then.
uid01021c66.msg:00f6:0x00000CBA:0100:10=From here, you can explore the city as you wish until the time runs out. Leaving the Shinsengumi Barracks through the front gate, going down the stairs, and heading to your left will put you on the main street of Kyo. Please enjoy your time here.
uid01021c6c.msg:004b:0x00000100:0028:1=(My work with the Shinsengumi starts tomorrow. Better turn in at Teradaya.)
uid01021c6d.msg:001c:0x0000212C:0028:1=Thank you for your business!
uid01021c6d.msg:0040:0x00002149:0034:2=Well, if it isn't the illustrious Captain of the Third Division.
uid01021c6d.msg:002c:0x0000218A:0040:3=Your first day went quicker than I imagined.
uid01021c6d.msg:0029:0x000021B7:004c:4=Well. I only had to put in an appearance.
uid01021c6d.msg:004f:0x000021E1:0058:5=I still can't believe you really enlisted. And they started you off at captain!
uid01021c6d.msg:0027:0x00002231:0064:6=Heh. Still worried about your rent now?
uid01021c6d.msg:0055:0x00002259:0070:7=Of course I am. There are plenty of reckless fools who die before paying their debts.
uid01021c6d.msg:0033:0x000022AF:007c:8=I won't stop worrying until the money's in my hand.
uid01021c6d.msg:002e:0x000022E3:0088:9=Heh. That sounds like something you would say.
uid01021c6d.msg:0010:0x00002313:00a0:10=What's in there?
uid01021c6d.msg:0031:0x00002324:00ac:11=My division's haori. I'll be wearing it tomorrow.
uid01021c6d.msg:0028:0x00002356:00b8:12=Ah yes, the infamous captain's sky-blue.
uid01021c6d.msg:0035:0x0000237F:00c4:13=Hand it over and we'll stitch it up some. Sound good?
uid01021c6d.msg:000d:0x000023B5:00d0:14=Sounds great.
uid01021c6d.msg:0037:0x000023C3:00dc:15=Don't get too excited. We'll be putting it on your tab.
uid01021c6d.msg:000a:0x00002402:00f4:16=Oryo-chan?
uid01021c6d.msg:0004:0x0000240F:0118:17=Yes?
uid01021c6d.msg:0021:0x00002414:0124:18=What can I do you for, Okami-san?
uid01021c6d.msg:0048:0x00002436:0130:19=Hajime-san needs his coat fixed up by tomorrow. Won't you do it for him?
uid01021c6d.msg:000a:0x00002486:0148:20=Oryo-chan?
uid01021c6d.msg:0009:0x00002491:0154:21=I refuse.
uid01021c6d.msg:0023:0x000024A2:016c:22=What's gotten into you, young lady?
uid01021c6d.msg:0036:0x000024C6:0178:23=Why should I lend a hand to a sheep in wolf's clothes?
uid01021c6d.msg:003a:0x000024FD:0184:24=He's no wolf, hun. This is Hajime-san we're talking about.
uid01021c6d.msg:0017:0x00002538:0190:25=I don't care who it is!
uid01021c6d.msg:003c:0x00002550:019c:26=Hajime-san's made his choice—to join the ranks of killers!
uid01021c6d.msg:0007:0x0000258D:01a8:27=Oryo...
uid01021c6d.msg:0023:0x00002595:01b4:28=Filthy murderers... I hate you all!
uid01021c6d.msg:0014:0x000025B9:01c0:29=Come now, Oryo-chan!
uid01021c6d.msg:001e:0x000025D5:01d8:30=That sure didn't go over well.
uid01021c6d.msg:002b:0x000025F4:01e4:31=Does she have some sort of history with...?
uid01021c6d.msg:0045:0x00002620:01f0:32=With your new friends? Well, her dad was killed by a Bakufu official.
uid01021c6d.msg:0010:0x00002666:01fc:33=I had no idea...
uid01021c6d.msg:0031:0x00002677:0208:34=I should mention, her dad was an ardent loyalist.
uid01021c6d.msg:0049:0x000026A9:0214:35=So you can see why she might be touchy about people with license to kill.
uid01021c6d.msg:005c:0x000026F3:0220:36=What's more, she probably can't stand seeing the man she fancies turn into what she loathes.
uid01021c6d.msg:0025:0x00002750:022c:37=Fancies? ...Oryo has feelings for me?
uid01021c6d.msg:0017:0x00002776:0238:38=You really have to ask?
uid01021c6d.msg:0047:0x0000278E:0244:39=My, how dense you are! Oryo-chan fell for a real charmer, didn't she...
uid01021c6d.msg:002c:0x000027D6:0250:40=You've seen the way she goggles at you, yes?
uid01021c6d.msg:002d:0x00002803:025c:41=I mean, I haven't noticed anything unusual...
uid01021c6d.msg:0025:0x00002831:0268:42=Goodness, this is going to be tricky.
uid01021c6d.msg:0030:0x00002857:0274:43=But for now, I suggest you stop standing around.
uid01021c6d.msg:0039:0x00002888:0280:44=Go learn how to console a girl you just brought to tears.
uid01021c6d.msg:0030:0x000028C2:028c:45=But I don't even know where she would've gone...
uid01021c6d.msg:0062:0x000028F3:0298:46=Kamo River, I imagine? Nothing like a quiet river to soothe you when you're alone and heartbroken.
uid01021c6d.msg:0033:0x00002956:02a4:47=Kamo River, huh... Guess I'd better get over there.
uid01021c72.msg:0005:0x00001AD7:004c:1=Oryo.
uid01021c72.msg:002b:0x00001AE5:0070:2=Otose told me what happened to your father.
uid01021c72.msg:0006:0x00001B11:007c:3=...Oh.
uid01021c72.msg:0033:0x00001B1F:0094:4=Hajime-san, why'd you have to join the Shinsengumi?
uid01021c72.msg:0045:0x00001B5A:00ac:5=Was it money? To gain status? Or... do you just enjoy killing others?
uid01021c72.msg:0011:0x00001BA0:00b8:6=No, none of that.
uid01021c72.msg:0013:0x00001BB3:00d0:7=Then... what is it?
uid01021c72.msg:003f:0x00001BC7:00dc:8=I joined the Shinsengumi specifically in order to find someone.
uid01021c72.msg:0010:0x00001C07:00e8:9=To find someone?
uid01021c72.msg:003a:0x00001C19:0100:10=Yeah. I need to find this person, no matter what it takes.
uid01021c72.msg:002b:0x00001C54:010c:11=Joining the Shinsengumi was my only option.
uid01021c72.msg:0062:0x00001C80:0118:12=You really expect me to believe you're joining the ranks of killers just to find a missing person?
uid01021c72.msg:0025:0x00001CE3:0124:13=I know that might be hard to swallow.
uid01021c72.msg:0062:0x00001D09:0130:14=But on the other hand, I'm Captain of the Third Division. I could use my influence for the better.
uid01021c72.msg:0064:0x00001D6C:013c:15=If I do things right, I might even be able to stop any needless violence. At least among my own men.
uid01021c72.msg:002f:0x00001DD1:0148:16=You would really try to change the Shinsengumi?
uid01021c72.msg:0049:0x00001E01:0154:17=I know it won't bring your father back, but trying is the least I can do.
uid01021c72.msg:0052:0x00001E4B:0160:18=So then... maybe fewer people will end up like me. I suppose I can live with that.
uid01021c72.msg:0026:0x00001E9E:016c:19=Yeah. That's a good way to look at it.
uid01021c72.msg:003d:0x00001ECC:0184:20=Now, why don't you head on back? Otose was worried about you.
uid01021c72.msg:0005:0x00001F0A:0190:21=Okay.
uid01021c72.msg:000b:0x00001F11:01a8:22=Hajime-san?
uid01021c72.msg:0004:0x00001F1D:01b4:23=Yes?
uid01021c72.msg:000a:0x00001F23:01cc:24=Thank you.
uid01021c72.msg:0005:0x00001F2E:01d8:25=Sure.
uid01021c72.msg:0030:0x00001F41:0238:26=(And with that, I should head back to Teradaya.)
uid01021c76.msg:0012:0x00000BF9:0034:1=Welcome back, hun.
uid01021c76.msg:0017:0x00000C0C:0040:2=Did Oryo get here safe?
uid01021c76.msg:004b:0x00000C25:0058:3=She did. I oughta say, you're better with women than I gave you credit for.
uid01021c76.msg:000d:0x00000C71:0064:4=You did good.
uid01021c76.msg:0022:0x00000C7F:0070:5=Heh. Only because you asked me to.
uid01021c76.msg:0016:0x00000CA2:007c:6=Hehe, I'm not so sure.
uid01021c76.msg:0049:0x00000CB9:0088:7=By the way, while you were out, there was someone who came by to see you.
uid01021c76.msg:001e:0x00000D03:0094:8=Really? What someone was this?
uid01021c76.msg:0053:0x00000D22:00a0:9=How should I describe him...? He was a samurai with maybe a hint of a Tosan accent.
uid01021c76.msg:0009:0x00000D76:00ac:10=Tosan...?
uid01021c76.msg:003f:0x00000D80:00b8:11=I think so. He said he'd be waiting for you at Kiyomizu Temple.
uid01021c76.msg:0010:0x00000DC0:00c4:12=Kiyomizu Temple?
uid01021c76.msg:0035:0x00000DD1:00d0:13=Yup. I did tell him I had no idea when you'd be back.
uid01021c76.msg:0027:0x00000E07:00dc:14=But he told me to tell you that anyway.
uid01021c76.msg:0059:0x00000E2F:00e8:15=Pretty rare for anyone to come looking for you. Could it be because you're a captain now?
uid01021c76.msg:002c:0x00000E89:00f4:16=Good question. I think I'll go and find out.
uid01021c7a.msg:0054:0x00004CC8:0048:1=Phew... No wonder you made Shinsengumi captain so quick. You're a hell of a fighter.
uid01021c7a.msg:0022:0x00004D1D:0054:2=Hey, I could say the same for you.
uid01021c7a.msg:0031:0x00004D40:0060:3=Heh. Well, here's to our first stint as partners.
uid01021c7a.msg:0072:0x00004D72:006c:4=For now, I think I'll move my base of operations to Teradaya, and we can update each other from there. Sound good?
uid01021c7a.msg:002f:0x00004DE5:0078:5=Yeah. Do you still plan on going after Takechi?
uid01021c7a.msg:0028:0x00004E15:0084:6=No. For now, I'm done investigating him.
uid01021c7a.msg:0055:0x00004E3E:0090:7=Besides, he's already back in Tosa. I'm setting my sights on the Shinsengumi instead.
uid01021c7a.msg:0037:0x00004E94:009c:8=Wait a minute. Did you just say Takechi's back in Tosa?
uid01021c7a.msg:0057:0x00004ECC:00a8:9=You haven't heard? He was summoned by the lord of Tosa, who recently returned from Edo.
uid01021c7a.msg:000e:0x00004F24:00b4:10=Okay. But why?
uid01021c7a.msg:0077:0x00004F33:00c0:11=Well, that lord is Yamauchi Yodo. After losing his standing in the Ansei Purge, he was forced to retire in the country.
uid01021c7a.msg:003d:0x00004FAB:00cc:12=Seems he got caught up in the Bakufu power struggle and lost.
uid01021c7a.msg:0047:0x00004FE9:00d8:13=But naturally, he still has a lot of local influence back home in Tosa.
uid01021c7a.msg:0050:0x00005031:00e4:14=For a man in his position, he's actually pretty smart. Any of this making sense?
uid01021c7a.msg:0007:0x00005082:00f0:15=Sure...
uid01021c7a.msg:004b:0x0000508A:00fc:16=Anyhow, Lord Yodo left Tosa in the hands of Yoshida Toyo while he was away.
uid01021c7a.msg:006a:0x000050D6:0108:17=But as you know, Toyo was assassinated. So, Lord Yodo was finally allowed by the Bakufu to return to Tosa.
uid01021c7a.msg:0032:0x00005141:0114:18=Why would someone like him summon Takechi, though?
uid01021c7a.msg:0076:0x00005174:0120:19=Not sure, and therein lies the rub. Somehow, Takechi Hanpeita tamed the elders of Tosa and became its de facto leader.
uid01021c7a.msg:002e:0x000051EB:012c:20=And I assume Lord Yodo's not pleased about it.
uid01021c7a.msg:005f:0x0000521A:0138:21=Even one year ago, if Lord Yodo was there, I doubt the Loyalist Party could've ever taken root.
uid01021c7a.msg:004f:0x0000527A:0144:22=Then what you're saying is, Takechi and the Tosa Loyalist Party are in trouble?
uid01021c7a.msg:0049:0x000052CA:0150:23=Depends on what Lord Yodo decides to do. For now, all we can do is watch.
uid01021c7a.msg:0050:0x00005314:015c:24=But for now, there's work to be done. We need to find this masked man, don't we?
uid01021c7a.msg:007c:0x0000536C:0174:25=Remember, Takechi's not the one infiltrating the Shinsengumi. You're in a way riskier position than he is. At least for now.
uid01021c7a.msg:0009:0x000053EA:018c:26=...Right.
uid01021c7a.msg:004f:0x000053F6:01b0:27=...Now I see. So that's why you're in the Shinsengumi. To find this masked man.
uid01021c7a.msg:0005:0x00005446:01bc:28=Yeah.
uid01021c7a.msg:003c:0x0000544C:01c8:29=That's dangerous water you're treading. Anything come of it?
uid01021c7a.msg:0046:0x00005489:01d4:30=I'm pretty confident it wasn't Yamanami Keisuke or Nagakura Shinpachi.
uid01021c7a.msg:0039:0x000054D0:01e0:31=But that's all I've managed to figure out since I joined.
uid01021c7a.msg:003b:0x0000550A:01ec:32=Even so, that's impressive for being a new recruit and all.
uid01021c7a.msg:004b:0x00005546:01f8:33=But, now that you're a captain, it won't be easy gathering intel unnoticed.
uid01021c7a.msg:003b:0x00005592:0204:34=What I propose, Sakamoto-san, is we cooperate from here on.
uid01021c7a.msg:003a:0x000055D5:021c:35=I've been chasing Toyo-sama's killer just the same as you.
uid01021c7a.msg:0040:0x00005610:0228:36=Don't you think we were brought here for a reason? It has to be.
uid01021c7a.msg:001f:0x00005652:0240:37=Yeah, I think you may be right.
uid01021c7a.msg:0018:0x00005672:024c:38=Good! Then it's settled.
uid01021c7a.msg:000a:0x0000568B:0258:39=Heh... Ah!
uid01021c7a.msg:000d:0x00005697:0270:40=Who are they?
uid01021c7a.msg:0050:0x000056A5:027c:41=Bad news. They're Tosa loyalists. Maybe they've figured out I'm on to Takechi...
uid01021c7a.msg:0017:0x000056F6:0288:42=Nakaoka Shintaro, yeah?
uid01021c7a.msg:002c:0x0000570E:0294:43=I'm the one they want. Make yourself scarce.
uid01021c7a.msg:0023:0x0000573B:02a0:44=I doubt they'll just let me escape.
uid01021c7a.msg:0015:0x0000575F:02ac:45=Yeah... Probably not.
uid01021c7a.msg:0050:0x00005775:02b8:46=Enemies of the loyalists, prepare to be scrubbed from the earth. Any last words?
uid01021c7a.msg:0049:0x000057C7:02d0:47=This man has nothing to do with you or me. Mind letting him off the hook?
uid01021c7a.msg:003c:0x00005811:02dc:48=Hmph. Like you'd run into him in a secluded place like this!
uid01021c7a.msg:002c:0x00005851:0300:49=Dammit. Sorry to get you wrapped up in this.
uid01021c7a.msg:0037:0x0000587E:030c:50=It's fine. And it's not like I'm completely uninvolved.
uid01021c7a.msg:0011:0x000058B6:0318:51=...I owe you one.
uid01021c7a.msg:0020:0x000058C9:0330:52=On my mark, let the bullets fly!
uid01021c7a.msg:002f:0x000058EB:0348:53=All right, Nakaoka. Tell me who you really are.
uid01021c7a.msg:0034:0x0000591B:0354:54=Yoshida Toyo's retainer... former retainer, that is.
uid01021c7a.msg:0027:0x00005950:0360:55=I owe the man a debt I can never repay.
uid01021c7a.msg:000d:0x00005978:036c:56=You owe Pops?
uid01021c7a.msg:004b:0x00005986:0378:57=Still calling him "Pops"? Heh, you called him the same thing way back when.
uid01021c7a.msg:000e:0x000059D2:0384:58=Way back when?
uid01021c7a.msg:0052:0x000059E1:0390:59=The night that Toyo-sama was killed... I was there, though I couldn't do anything.
uid01021c7a.msg:0026:0x00005A37:03c0:60=Wait, you were there when it happened?
uid01021c7a.msg:0058:0x00005A5E:03cc:61=By the time we heard the commotion and rushed over, Toyo-sama was already on the ground.
uid01021c7a.msg:003e:0x00005AB7:03d8:62=You and Takechi Hanpeita were the only ones there ahead of us.
uid01021c7a.msg:002a:0x00005AF6:03e4:63=But... How did you know Takechi was there?
uid01021c7a.msg:0047:0x00005B21:03f0:64=By the time the officials showed up, I was the only person in the room.
uid01021c7a.msg:0061:0x00005B69:03fc:65=I told you, I was Toyo-sama's retainer. I was told in secret about everyone who had been present.
uid01021c7a.msg:0008:0x00005BCB:0408:66=I see...
uid01021c7a.msg:0049:0x00005BD4:0414:67=Of course, I was dismissed from my post for failing to protect Toyo-sama.
uid01021c7a.msg:0035:0x00005C1E:0420:68=In fact, my whole life came crashing down after that.
uid01021c7a.msg:0055:0x00005C5B:0438:69=But, I eventually moved on. No point for a retainer to hang around a lordless castle.
uid01021c7a.msg:0054:0x00005CB2:0450:70=Still, I'll never forgive the bastard who killed him. That'd be you, Sakamoto Ryoma.
uid01021c7a.msg:0048:0x00005D07:045c:71=Well? What do you intend to do? Cut me down on the spot? I'm right here.
uid01021c7a.msg:006d:0x00005D51:0474:72=Heh. That was just a little joke. After all, you are the official suspect for the murder. At least on record.
uid01021c7a.msg:0016:0x00005DBF:0480:73=And what do you think?
uid01021c7a.msg:0036:0x00005DD6:048c:74=Me? I'd say the real guy's still out there, somewhere.
uid01021c7a.msg:0061:0x00005E0F:04a4:75=Think about it. What could you possibly gain from killing Toyo-sama—the man who brought you up?
uid01021c7a.msg:0052:0x00005E71:04b0:76=That got you exiled, forced to live as a ronin in a foreign city under an alias...
uid01021c7a.msg:004d:0x00005EC4:04bc:77=And you'd have lost your mentor on top of it. Who in the world would do that?
uid01021c7a.msg:002b:0x00005F12:04c8:78=Then, do you know who the real murderer is?
uid01021c7a.msg:0022:0x00005F3E:04d4:79=Takechi Hanpeita. That's my guess.
uid01021c7a.msg:0012:0x00005F61:04e0:80=That's impossible!
uid01021c7a.msg:0043:0x00005F74:04ec:81=Just look at his rise to prominence, along with his Loyalist Party.
uid01021c7a.msg:005d:0x00005FB8:04f8:82=If Toyo-sama were still alive, no way he would have been able to accomplish all that in Tosa.
uid01021c7a.msg:003f:0x00006016:0504:83=Why, he's even a joshi now. Who else stood to profit that much?
uid01021c7a.msg:0011:0x00006056:0510:84=He would never...
uid01021c7a.msg:0021:0x00006068:051c:85=Can you really say that for sure?
uid01021c7a.msg:002e:0x00006091:0534:86=Well, at least I can see why you're after him.
uid01021c7a.msg:0050:0x000060C0:0540:87=Uh-huh. Hell of a coincidence running into you as I was sniffing around for him.
uid01021c7a.msg:0063:0x00006111:054c:88=All right. I'll admit, your reasoning is pretty solid. But I'm afraid you've missed a crucial fact.
uid01021c7a.msg:0010:0x00006175:0558:89=And what's that?
uid01021c7a.msg:004f:0x00006186:0564:90=Before you and your officials arrived, there was one other person at the scene.
uid01021c7a.msg:007d:0x000061D6:0570:91=I call him "the masked man." My brother and I both saw him... He cut Pops down without hesitation. He's the one we both seek.
uid01021c7a.msg:0045:0x00006254:057c:92=And when I find him, I'll finally learn the truth of why it happened.
uid01021c7a.msg:004b:0x0000629A:0588:93=Is that right... It seems you've got a lot of missing pieces to the puzzle.
uid01021c7a.msg:001c:0x000062E6:0594:94=If you'll talk, I'll listen.
uid01021c7a.msg:0020:0x00006303:05a0:95=Heh. It's gonna be a long story.
uid01021c89.msg:0051:0x000000F0:0028:1=(Todo was going to explain my work to me today. I should head to the barracks...)
uid01021c8a.msg:0049:0x00001795:0074:1=So, that just about does it. That's all the work you gotta do as captain.
uid01021c8a.msg:007c:0x000017DF:0080:2=Elite Troopers have been unlocked.  These troopers come packing powerful abilities, so don't forget to get them out there!
uid01021c8a.msg:000b:0x0000185D:0098:3=Understood.
uid01021c8a.msg:0036:0x00001869:00a4:4=Seeing how late it is now, why don't we call it a day?
uid01021c8a.msg:0021:0x000018A0:00b0:5=Thanks for being a quick learner.
uid01021c8a.msg:0007:0x000018C3:00c8:6=Uh-huh.
uid01021c8a.msg:0037:0x000018D0:0110:7=(The sun's already set. Time to head back to Teradaya.)
uid01021c8a.msg:0070:0x00001909:0128:8=You can obtain these Elite Troopers from the <%download_content%> "Elite Generals Trooper Card Bundle" for free.
uid01021c8a.msg:0096:0x0000197C:014c:9=You probably didn't know this, but before he died, Yamanami-san and his Third Division were assigned a special mission—aside from the usual patrols.
uid01021c8a.msg:0043:0x00001A13:0158:10=And as his successor, you'll be inheriting that mission, Saito-san.
uid01021c8a.msg:0069:0x00001A58:0170:11=If you want the dirty details, go talk to the man at the desk. I already told him you'd be coming around.
uid01021c8a.msg:0026:0x00001AC2:017c:12=I'll be waiting here 'til you're done.
uid01021c8a.msg:008b:0x00001AEA:0194:13=Each captain has their own private quarters. I'm sure you've already been shown around, but I wanted to make sure you knew about your room.
uid01021c8a.msg:004c:0x00001B76:01a0:14=You can use it when you wanna take a break, or just get ready for something.
uid01021c8a.msg:0015:0x00001BC3:01ac:15=So, shall we move on?
uid01021c8a.msg:0005:0x00001BDA:01c4:16=Okay.
uid01021c8a.msg:0067:0x00001BE1:01dc:17=This is the warehouse. We use it for more than just storage... but I suppose I should leave it at that.
uid01021c8a.msg:0019:0x00001C49:01e8:18=Anyway, let's keep going.
uid01021c8a.msg:0007:0x00001C64:0200:19=Sure...
uid01021c8a.msg:005a:0x00001C6D:0218:20=This is where you were yesterday. All the important meetings are in this main temple here.
uid01021c8a.msg:0020:0x00001CC8:0224:21=Come on, I got more to show you.
uid01021c8a.msg:000a:0x00001CEA:023c:22=All right.
uid01021c8e.msg:0014:0x000009D4:0038:1=So why are you here?
uid01021c8e.msg:004d:0x000009E9:0044:2=Didn't Todo-san tell you already? About the deserter from the Third Division?
uid01021c8e.msg:003a:0x00000A37:0050:3=From my division? Right, I believe his name was Akimoto...
uid01021c8e.msg:002f:0x00000A72:005c:4=Correct. I've managed to pinpoint his location.
uid01021c8e.msg:003a:0x00000AA2:0068:5=And I believe his capture was entrusted to you, Saito-san.
uid01021c8e.msg:0036:0x00000ADD:0074:6=Yes, so I've heard. Are you gonna tell me where he is?
uid01021c8e.msg:0065:0x00000B14:0080:7=In a place called Hinata over in Gion. Likely drinking himself into a stupor with his favorite woman.
uid01021c8e.msg:005a:0x00000B7A:008c:8=What a buffoon he is. Perhaps he wanted to make some memories before fleeing Kyo for good.
uid01021c8e.msg:002a:0x00000BD5:0098:9=I see. I'll make my way there immediately.
uid01021c8e.msg:0045:0x00000C00:00a4:10=It's your first mission, so do be careful. Now if you'll excuse me...
uid01021c8e.msg:0062:0x00000C4F:00d4:11=(So Akimoto did flee, but made a stop at Hinata. That's in Gion... I need to get over there fast.)
uid01021c92.msg:0017:0x000008B7:004c:1=You're late, Saito-san.
uid01021c92.msg:0017:0x000008CF:0058:2=Todo? Why are you here?
uid01021c92.msg:0066:0x000008E7:0064:3=Hijikata-san told me to be here. Since it's your first job, he thought you should have some insurance.
uid01021c92.msg:0017:0x0000094E:0070:4=I don't need insurance.
uid01021c92.msg:0071:0x00000966:007c:5=I really hope that's true. If the Third Division loses its captain again, that's another name I have to memorize.
uid01021c92.msg:0055:0x000009DF:0094:6=I admit, you do seem like a pretty capable guy. You can take him on by yourself, yes?
uid01021c92.msg:002e:0x00000A35:00a0:7=I'll block the exit here so he can't run away.
uid01021c92.msg:0017:0x00000A64:00ac:8=Good. Perfect, in fact.
uid01021c96.msg:0005:0x00002380:0048:1=Yipe!
uid01021c96.msg:003d:0x00002386:0054:2=I question how you ever got into the Shinsengumi. Now get up.
uid01021c96.msg:0027:0x000023C4:0060:3=W-W-W-Wait! Stay your sword, I beg you!
uid01021c96.msg:0023:0x000023EC:006c:4=Grow a spine. Your lady's watching.
uid01021c96.msg:0035:0x00002410:0078:5=Just hear me out! I don't wanna go back there, okay!?
uid01021c96.msg:0036:0x00002446:0084:6=The only reason I got in was through my connections...
uid01021c96.msg:0034:0x0000247D:0090:7=And I thought I could just quit if I didn't like it!
uid01021c96.msg:0037:0x000024B2:009c:8=Why would a coward like you join up in the first place?
uid01021c96.msg:0059:0x000024EA:00a8:9=Well, you know why... I figured it'd elevate my status and make me a hit with the ladies!
uid01021c96.msg:0047:0x00002544:00b4:10=But that's before I found out they're just a bunch of deranged killers!
uid01021c96.msg:002a:0x0000258C:00c0:11=I would never murder just to get some ass!
uid01021c96.msg:0043:0x000025BE:00d8:12=Please! I can give you money—as much as you want! Just let me go!
uid01021c96.msg:004f:0x00002602:00e4:13=Enough. A man's gotta bring ass to get ass. But you'd better get your ass gone.
uid01021c96.msg:000f:0x00002652:00f0:14=Yeah? You sure?
uid01021c96.msg:0010:0x00002669:0150:15=Oh? And you are?
uid01021c96.msg:003c:0x00002681:0168:16=I'm with the Shinsengumi. Is there a man named Akimoto here?
uid01021c96.msg:0063:0x000026BE:0174:17=Aww, I thought someone finally wanted to see <i>me</i> for once. Akimoto-kun's out picking flowers.
uid01021c96.msg:0030:0x00002722:0180:18=So he's using the outhouse. Where would that be?
uid01021c96.msg:0047:0x00002753:018c:19=Hey, let's not sweat the small stuff. Why don't you and I have a drink?
uid01021c96.msg:0004:0x0000279B:0198:20=Huh?
uid01021c96.msg:005c:0x000027A0:01a4:21=I tried to cozy up to him 'cause he's with the Shinsengumi, but the man's such a cheapskate!
uid01021c96.msg:004d:0x000027FD:01b0:22=I heard he just got in because he knew somebody, anyway. So forget about him.
uid01021c96.msg:0045:0x00002852:01c8:23=But you? You look like you've got integrity. Easy on the eyes, too...
uid01021c96.msg:0045:0x00002898:01d4:24=And that vivid haori, that's something only the captains wear, right?
uid01021c96.msg:001c:0x000028DE:01e0:25=You sure seem to know a lot.
uid01021c96.msg:0061:0x000028FB:01ec:26=Of course I do. When it comes to the Shinsengumi, women want them and men want to <i>be</i> them.
uid01021c96.msg:0083:0x0000295D:01f8:27=And when we're talking about a captain? They could wrap anyone in town around their finger, myself included. Do you catch my drift?
uid01021c96.msg:003b:0x000029E8:0210:28=Now if you want me, come and get me. No need to play coy...
uid01021c96.msg:002b:0x00002A24:021c:29=Get your filthy self away from Mizuki-chan!
uid01021c96.msg:0019:0x00002A52:0240:30=Aww, you're back already.
uid01021c96.msg:0059:0x00002A6C:024c:31=So you're Akimoto... Well, you must know why I'm here. Time to come back to the barracks.
uid01021c96.msg:0004:0x00002AC6:0258:32=Keh!
uid01021c96.msg:006b:0x00002ACD:027c:33=Hehe... Hehehe! Sorry, not happening! Instead, I'm gonna cut you down and blow this joint with Mizuki-chan!
uid01021c96.msg:0041:0x00002B39:0288:34=After that, we're gonna live happily ever after in the mountains!
uid01021c96.msg:002c:0x00002B7B:0294:35=Are you prepared to stake your life on that?
uid01021c96.msg:0016:0x00002BA8:02a0:36=Shut up! And eat shit!
uid01021c96.msg:002d:0x00002BC1:02c4:37=Uh, i-is there something I can help you with?
uid01021c96.msg:0047:0x00002BEF:02d0:38=I'm with the Shinsengumi. Not here to cause trouble, but I'm coming in.
uid01021c96.msg:000b:0x00002C38:02e8:39=Oh, wait...
uid01021c9e.msg:005e:0x000000F0:0028:1=(So the deserter Akimoto gets executed on the spot... I should report back to the barracks...)
uid01021c9f.msg:0012:0x00001B1A:0040:1=(What's going on?)
uid01021c9f.msg:0045:0x00001B2E:0058:2=Got all that? Us Seventh Division guys are gonna handle it ourselves.
uid01021c9f.msg:004e:0x00001B74:0064:3=That way, we'll get the entire bounty. We could be drowning in money or women!
uid01021c9f.msg:001b:0x00001BC3:0070:4=Tani, did something happen?
uid01021c9f.msg:0037:0x00001BDF:007c:5=Huh? Heh. Saito, this don't concern ya. Boys, let's go!
uid01021c9f.msg:0014:0x00001C1B:00b8:6=What was that about?
uid01021c9f.msg:000e:0x00001C30:00c4:7=Saito, was it?
uid01021c9f.msg:000f:0x00001C41:00e8:8=And you were...
uid01021c9f.msg:0044:0x00001C51:00f4:9=Inoue, Captain of the Sixth. In any case, Izo the Butcher's in town.
uid01021c9f.msg:0029:0x00001C96:0100:10=Izo the Butcher... Do you mean Okada Izo?
uid01021c9f.msg:003b:0x00001CC0:010c:11=Yeah. One of the head honchos from the Tosa Loyalist Party.
uid01021c9f.msg:0060:0x00001CFC:0118:12=He's eliminated several Bakufu personnel, so the Shinsengumi's been after him for quite a while.
uid01021c9f.msg:0011:0x00001D5D:0124:13=I wasn't aware...
uid01021c9f.msg:0065:0x00001D6F:0130:14=Izo killed one of our own near the banks of the Kamo River. Then Inspector Yamazaki tracked him down.
uid01021c9f.msg:000d:0x00001DDC:0148:15=What's wrong?
uid01021c9f.msg:0011:0x00001DEA:0154:16=Oh, it's nothing.
uid01021c9f.msg:0023:0x00001DFC:0160:17=Your face doesn't say it's nothing.
uid01021c9f.msg:003a:0x00001E27:0178:18=Anyhow, the magistrate's office has made Izo a wanted man.
uid01021c9f.msg:006d:0x00001E62:0184:19=They want him alive, but it's Tani and Suzuki on the hunt. Knowing them, they'd just as soon cut him in half.
uid01021c9f.msg:0077:0x00001ED2:019c:20=They're heading to a gambling den in Rakugai. I suggest you tag along. But don't underestimate Izo. It could cost you.
uid01021c9f.msg:0030:0x00001F4C:01c0:21=Izo... Our blades and our paths keep crossing...
uid01021c9f.msg:010b:0x00001F80:01f0:22=<kf:1>Night Mode is primarily for battle. Follow the pink destination marker shown on your map to reach a gambling den where you'll find the powerful foe Okada Izo.  You can also open the Pause Menu using <symbol=button_options> to check out equipment and troopers.
uid01021ca6.msg:0057:0x00000100:0028:1=(The Shinsengumi's after Izo! He was seen at a gambling den in Rakugai. I gotta hurry!)

uid01021ca7.msg:0012:0x00003A97:00d0:2=We should go, too.

uid01021ca7.msg:003b:0x00003B0C:01f0:7=Tch, so you came. You really want the bounty that bad, huh?
uid01021ca7.msg:002f:0x00003B48:01fc:8=I invited him. Our numbers were too few anyway.
uid01021ca7.msg:006c:0x00003B78:0208:9=Huh? What's the gray old man of the Sixth Division babblin' about? Yer nothin' but deadweight, ya know that?
uid01021ca7.msg:0019:0x00003BE5:0214:10=I will not be deadweight.

uid01021ca7.msg:0059:0x00003C3B:0238:12=Shut it, Suzuki. You're no more useful than they are. <i>I'll</i> be the one to take Izo!

uid01021cb3.msg:000d:0x000016A3:0040:2=That's right.
uid01021cb3.msg:0031:0x000016B1:004c:3=Which means you never had any intent to kill Izo.
uid01021cb3.msg:003b:0x000016E3:0058:4=Hmph. Of course not. My orders were to capture Okada alive.
uid01021cb3.msg:002e:0x0000171F:0064:5=Then why pretend that you were gonna kill him?
uid01021cb3.msg:002e:0x0000174E:0070:6=I just wanted to know how Saito Hajime thinks.
uid01021cb3.msg:003f:0x0000177D:007c:7=Because I don't need any more feral whelps like Tani or Suzuki.
uid01021cb3.msg:0017:0x000017BD:0088:8=So you were testing me?
uid01021cb3.msg:0063:0x000017D5:0094:9=I hope there are no hard feelings. It seemed like you were getting pretty friendly with Izo anyway.
uid01021cb3.msg:0016:0x00001839:00a0:10=Don't joke about that.
uid01021cb3.msg:0071:0x00001850:00ac:11=I mean, if a Shinsengumi officer possibly has some sort of connection with a Loyalist Party assassin, why then...

uid01021cb3.msg:004e:0x000018F9:00dc:13=Very well. By the way, would you like to know where Izo's being hauled off to?
uid01021cb3.msg:0036:0x00001948:00e8:14=What are you talking about? He'll be in a jail in Kyo.
uid01021cb3.msg:0010:0x0000197F:00f4:15=Not quite. Tosa.
uid01021cb3.msg:000f:0x00001990:0100:16=Tosa, you said?
uid01021cb3.msg:0056:0x000019A0:010c:17=Lord Yamauchi Yodo of Tosa arranged it all. Okada Izo will be delivered to him, alive.
uid01021cb3.msg:001d:0x000019F7:0118:18=What does he want out of Izo?
uid01021cb3.msg:0067:0x00001A15:0124:19=I'm not privy to the details, but I'm guessing Lord Yodo simply wants to crush the Tosa Loyalist Party.
uid01021cb3.msg:001e:0x00001A7D:0130:20=What...? Why would he do that?
uid01021cb3.msg:0046:0x00001A9C:013c:21=The Tosa Loyalist Party is controlled by a man named Takechi Hanpeita.
uid01021cb3.msg:005b:0x00001AE3:0148:22=Until recently, he was doing as he pleased in Tosa because Lord Yodo was still away in Edo.
uid01021cb3.msg:007d:0x00001B3F:0154:23=And since Izo was killing people under Takechi's orders, he's become the perfect tool for Lord Yodo to use against the Party.
uid01021cb3.msg:004c:0x00001BBD:0160:24=Once he gets to Tosa, Izo will be tortured in ways I do not wish to imagine.
uid01021cb3.msg:0047:0x00001C0A:016c:25=So if he breaks and confesses it was Takechi who gave him the orders...
uid01021cb3.msg:0082:0x00001C52:0178:26=Then Lord Yodo will be able to crush the Loyalist Party once and for all. Takechi will probably be executed, since he's a founder.
uid01021cb3.msg:0042:0x00001CD7:0190:27=...I'm starting to think it would've been better to kill Izo here.
uid01021cb3.msg:0048:0x00001D1A:019c:28=This can only bode ill for Tosa's loyalists... and for Takechi Hanpeita.
uid01021cb3.msg:002d:0x00001D63:01a8:29=Unthinkable... I've put them all in danger...
uid01021cb3.msg:0032:0x00001D96:01f0:30=(...All I can do for now is get back to Teradaya.)
uid01021cb7.msg:0020:0x00000F4D:0044:1=It's me, Nakaoka. I'm coming in.
uid01021cb7.msg:002e:0x00000F79:008c:2=I heard you were the one who caught Okada Izo.
uid01021cb7.msg:0076:0x00000FAF:00a4:3=The irony of it all... You capture one of your past allies, and it might end up putting Takechi on the chopping block.
uid01021cb7.msg:0041:0x0000102D:00bc:4=Oh, don't look that way. Takechi won't go down <i>too</i> easily.
uid01021cb7.msg:0070:0x0000106F:00c8:5=He knows why he's being called back by Lord Yodo. I'm sure he made plenty of preparations for this eventual day.
uid01021cb7.msg:000a:0x000010E0:00d4:6=I hope so.
uid01021cb7.msg:0016:0x000010EB:00e0:7=You worried about him?
uid01021cb7.msg:0005:0x00001102:00ec:8=No...
uid01021cb7.msg:0021:0x00001108:00f8:9=Good. He can handle his business.
uid01021cb7.msg:0070:0x0000112A:0104:10=Right now, you need to find out the truth behind Toyo-sama's death. You and I are the only ones who can do that.
uid01021cb7.msg:0035:0x0000119B:0110:11=And we consider Yoshida Toyo like a father, don't we?
uid01021cb7.msg:005f:0x000011D1:011c:12=Yeah, no doubt. That's why I started this path... One I'd never let Takechi Hanpeita walk down.
uid01021cb7.msg:0023:0x00001232:0134:13=...So don't you die on me, Brother.
uid01021cb7.msg:001b:0x00001257:014c:14=(I should call it a night.)
uid01021cb7.msg:002d:0x00001273:0158:15=(I think I'll wander around town a bit more.)
uid01021cb7.msg:0025:0x000012A1:0164:16=(I should call it a night already...)
uid01021cbe.msg:005f:0x000038B4:0038:1=(Setting fire to the palace and kidnapping the Emperor? The loyalists are going to extremes...)
uid01021cbe.msg:0044:0x00003914:0044:2=(Is Nakaoka really involved in this? He could be in serious danger.)
uid01021cbe.msg:002f:0x00003959:0050:3=(I should find him. He's probably at Teradaya.)
uid01021cbe.msg:0029:0x0000398E:0098:4=Um... Seems like we're a few butts short.
uid01021cbe.msg:0073:0x000039B8:00a4:5=Heh. Suzuki and Tani, you mean? They were dumb enough to get themselves killed last night. Fuck 'em, who needs 'em?
uid01021cbe.msg:002f:0x00003A2C:00b0:6=They were slain by Izo the Butcher. So it goes.
uid01021cbe.msg:0068:0x00003A5C:00bc:7=So, Suzuki Mikisaburo, eh? The advisor's good word's the only reason he made captain in the first place.
uid01021cbe.msg:0034:0x00003ACC:00d4:8=Ha. The Ito faction might not recover from this one.
uid01021cbe.msg:0037:0x00003B01:00e0:9=Who do you have left in your corner? Heisuke over here?
uid01021cbe.msg:006b:0x00003B39:00ec:10=Lay off! So Ito-san and I trained together once or twice. My time at Shieikan means I'm in Kondo's faction.
uid01021cbe.msg:0041:0x00003BA5:00f8:11=Maybe so. Ito-san and the chief only met through you, though, no?
uid01021cbe.msg:0060:0x00003BE7:0104:12=Who knows what he might've promised you to help him take over. You angling for the big boy seat?
uid01021cbe.msg:0017:0x00003C48:0110:13=That will do, Sanosuke.
uid01021cbe.msg:0081:0x00003C60:011c:14=The Shinsengumi has no factions. The chief, and all of us here, are comrades-in-arms and loyal to our country. Keep that in mind.
uid01021cbe.msg:0032:0x00003CE2:0128:15=Yeah, yeah. Forgive my impudence, O High Deputy...
uid01021cbe.msg:0055:0x00003D15:0134:16=Deputy Chief Hijikata is right. Our old allegiances and former dojos are in our past.
uid01021cbe.msg:0062:0x00003D6B:0140:17=Men of Shieikan are no more loyal than anyone else in this room. The Shinsengumi is a brotherhood.
uid01021cbe.msg:0021:0x00003DCE:014c:18=Wouldn't you agree, Deputy Chief?
uid01021cbe.msg:0008:0x00003DF0:0158:19=Utterly.
uid01021cbe.msg:002a:0x00003DFA:0170:20=We have more important matters to discuss.
uid01021cbe.msg:0089:0x00003E25:017c:21=Some of us did join this organization for love of country, in fact. "Shieikan," "Ito faction," I find these games of yours disrespectful.
uid01021cbe.msg:0026:0x00003EAF:0188:22=You really can kill a mood, Matsubara.
uid01021cbe.msg:0059:0x00003ED6:0194:23=Outside, loyalists are terrorizing Kyo. Choshu and Satsuma shishi run wild in the street.
uid01021cbe.msg:0055:0x00003F30:01a0:24=Deputy Chief, I have to know. Is it true? Has a Choshu agent really been apprehended?
uid01021cbe.msg:002f:0x00003F86:01ac:25=Ah... So you know why I've called you all here.
uid01021cbe.msg:0040:0x00003FB6:01b8:26=Soon, the Shinsengumi will make history. Listen to me carefully.
uid01021cbe.msg:0040:0x00003FFA:01e8:27=Last night, Inspector Yamazaki captured a spy for the loyalists.
uid01021cbe.msg:0062:0x0000403C:0200:28=His name: Furutaka Shuntaro. What's more, we discovered a major cache of gunpowder along with him.
uid01021cbe.msg:0030:0x000040A0:0218:29=Sittin' on gunpowder? Jus' what was he plannin'?
uid01021cbe.msg:003a:0x000040D1:0224:30=After some hours of torture, Furutaka kindly filled us in.
uid01021cbe.msg:005d:0x0000410C:0230:31=According to his confession... Forty shishi or so have conspired on quite an intriguing plot.
uid01021cbe.msg:0020:0x0000416A:023c:32=What the hell <i>kinda</i> plot?
uid01021cbe.msg:0054:0x0000418B:0248:33=A great fire... Set at the Imperial Palace. Destroying the very seat of the Emperor.
uid01021cbe.msg:0029:0x000041E0:0254:34=...The palace!? Helluva target for arson.
uid01021cbe.msg:0040:0x0000420A:0260:35=Hold on a second for me. That plan... It doesn't make any sense.
uid01021cbe.msg:006c:0x0000424B:026c:36=What the loyalists are loyal <i>to</i> is the Emperor, isn't it? Why would they go and set his home on fire?
uid01021cbe.msg:0049:0x000042B8:0278:37=With the palace aflame, every lawman in Kyo will be drawn in like a moth.
uid01021cbe.msg:005c:0x00004302:0284:38=That includes the Shinsengumi. They were going to surround us all and close in for the kill.
uid01021cbe.msg:0053:0x0000435F:0290:39=So they're finally comin' fer us, huh? 'Bout time. This might just get interestin'.
uid01021cbe.msg:003a:0x000043B3:029c:40=No. Their aim isn't merely our execution. It goes further.
uid01021cbe.msg:0046:0x000043EE:02a8:41=In the chaos, they would infiltrate the palace and kidnap the Emperor.
uid01021cbe.msg:0013:0x00004435:02b4:42=Kidnap him? Absurd!
uid01021cbe.msg:0058:0x00004449:02c0:43=These radicals are willing to abduct the man they claim to revere to serve their agenda.
uid01021cbe.msg:0054:0x000044A2:02cc:44=Once he's in tow, they'll force him to issue an imperial order to strike the Bakufu.
uid01021cbe.msg:0010:0x000044F7:02d8:45=How can this be?
uid01021cbe.msg:005f:0x00004508:02e4:46=Eh. Whadda we do about it, then? Forty scrawny shishi ain't too many to round up and deal with.
uid01021cbe.msg:0056:0x00004568:02f0:47=Keep your head on. Right now, Inspector Yamazaki is locating their base of operations.
uid01021cbe.msg:0065:0x000045BF:02fc:48=Once they realize one of their own has vanished, we can count on them to meet and revise their plans.
uid01021cbe.msg:003d:0x00004625:0308:49=That will be our chance. We'll eliminate all of them tonight.
uid01021cbe.msg:004f:0x00004663:0314:50=Alright! Now I'm wakin' up! Feels like a hundred years since I got some action!
uid01021cbe.msg:005b:0x000046B3:0320:51=Facin' forty shishi, we needa be smart about this shit. Hafta make sure there's a strategy.
uid01021cbe.msg:0031:0x0000470F:032c:52=Got one. Chop off every fuckin' head in the room.
uid01021cbe.msg:0072:0x00004741:0338:53=That's yer style. But mine? Koshu military tactics! Identify the leader, then take 'im out swift, smooth, 'n easy!
uid01021cbe.msg:003c:0x000047B4:0344:54=Hmph. And be the first one there to snatch his coin purse...
uid01021cbe.msg:0026:0x000047F1:0350:55=Money is what keeps our units runnin'.
uid01021cbe.msg:0044:0x00004818:035c:56=Deputy, what intelligence have we got? Who's the boss of these bums?
uid01021cbe.msg:0098:0x0000485D:0368:57=Of what we know, a Choshuan called Yoshida Toshimaro. Unfortunately, there are a lot of people involved in this little scheme. Hard to pin any one down.
uid01021cbe.msg:007c:0x000048F6:0374:58=From Choshu, Sakai and Kitano. And some from Tosa. Nagai, Sasaki, and Nakaoka are the names we've managed to collect so far.
uid01021cbe.msg:000f:0x00004973:0380:59=Did you say—?
uid01021cbe.msg:001b:0x00004983:038c:60=Hm? Saito? Something wrong?
uid01021cbe.msg:0019:0x0000499F:0398:61=No... I misheard, is all.
uid01021cbe.msg:0055:0x000049B9:03a4:62=Anyway! If Yoshida Toshimaro is the ringleader, that'll be the biggest bounty, right?
uid01021cbe.msg:0027:0x00004A0F:03b0:63=Well, that stands to reason, I suppose.
uid01021cbe.msg:000c:0x00004A37:03bc:64=Heheheheh...
uid01021cbe.msg:0028:0x00004A44:03c8:65=All right. Are there any questions left?
uid01021cbe.msg:0068:0x00004A6D:03d4:66=If not, Ito-san and I will adjourn to formulate our plan of attack. Until then, no one arouse suspicion.
uid01021cbe.msg:0048:0x00004AD6:03e0:67=Were any of you to slip up now, then this will all have been for naught.
uid01021cca.msg:0020:0x000020A6:0050:1=Oh, Sakamoto. What's the matter?
uid01021cca.msg:003d:0x000020C7:005c:2=Nakaoka, are loyalist shishi going to set fire to the palace?
uid01021cca.msg:0013:0x00002105:0068:3=Huh? Are you drunk?
uid01021cca.msg:001c:0x00002119:0074:4=You're not in on their plot?
uid01021cca.msg:0015:0x00002136:0080:5=Slow down. What plot?
uid01021cca.msg:0092:0x0000214C:008c:6=The Shinsengumi tortured a man named Furutaka Shuntaro. He claims forty loyalists are planning to set the palace on fire, then kidnap the Emperor.
uid01021cca.msg:0029:0x000021DF:0098:7=What the hell? They'd be mad to try that.
uid01021cca.msg:0084:0x00002209:00a4:8=The Shinsengumi just met. Somewhere in Kyo tonight, they're going to attack the loyalist base. They're arranging things as we speak.
uid01021cca.msg:0038:0x0000228E:00b0:9=Anybody who's there, the Shinsengumi will cut them down.
uid01021cca.msg:002c:0x000022C7:00bc:10=I understand. You came here to save my life.
uid01021cca.msg:0017:0x000022F4:00c8:11=And you... had no idea?
uid01021cca.msg:002f:0x0000230C:00d4:12=You think I'd agree to that harebrained scheme?
uid01021cca.msg:005e:0x0000233C:00e0:13=Listen, even for a just cause, the collateral damage from a palace fire would be indefensible.
uid01021cca.msg:0054:0x0000239B:00ec:14=Right. Who knows how many people could get hurt? The loyalists must have gone crazy.
uid01021cca.msg:0011:0x000023F0:00f8:15=That's damn true.
uid01021cca.msg:0062:0x00002402:0104:16=There were names—Tosans they think are involved in the plan. One of them was definitely Nakaoka.
uid01021cca.msg:002f:0x00002465:0110:17=Tosa has a lot of men with that name. Isn't me.
uid01021cca.msg:0051:0x00002495:011c:18=All the same, I can't sit here while the Shinsengumi are readying for a massacre.
uid01021cca.msg:003b:0x000024E7:0128:19=If the wolves are coming, I have to let the loyalists know.
uid01021cca.msg:001d:0x00002523:0134:20=Can you contact them somehow?
uid01021cca.msg:0029:0x00002541:0140:21=Maybe. Any idea who's heading this thing?
uid01021cca.msg:0033:0x0000256B:014c:22=I think so. Yoshida Toshimaro is what they told us.
uid01021cca.msg:0048:0x0000259F:0158:23=Yoshida Toshimaro? He's pretty high up. Takechi even knows him, I think.
uid01021cca.msg:0043:0x000025E8:0164:24=What? So then... could Takechi have actually approved of this idea?
uid01021cca.msg:0053:0x0000262C:0170:25=We can't be sure, but I doubt they'd burn Kyo down without keeping him in the loop.
uid01021cca.msg:0073:0x00002680:017c:26=The man himself is back home right now, but if there are Tosan loyalists here, like you said? They're his comrades.
uid01021cca.msg:002a:0x000026F4:0188:27=Takechi. How could he have agreed to this?
uid01021cca.msg:0022:0x0000271F:0194:28=I know it must be hard to swallow.
uid01021cca.msg:0057:0x00002742:01a0:29=The ones you consider family? No one wants to think they'd be capable of some atrocity.
uid01021cca.msg:0075:0x0000279A:01ac:30=For now, we have to focus on Yoshida Toshimaro, though. Let him know he needs to lay low for a while. I'll handle it.
uid01021cca.msg:000c:0x00002810:01b8:31=On your own?
uid01021cca.msg:0078:0x0000281D:01c4:32=What else can I do? You head back to the Shinsengumi and keep up appearances. Don't let them know you let anything slip.
uid01021cca.msg:000d:0x00002896:01d0:33=You're right.
uid01021cca.msg:0038:0x000028A4:01dc:34=Remember, we both have stories. Can't let yours end yet.
uid01021cca.msg:000e:0x000028DD:01e8:35=Well, I'm off.
uid01021cca.msg:0005:0x000028EC:01f4:36=Yeah.
uid01021cca.msg:0042:0x000028F5:0224:37=(All right, then. At least Nakaoka wasn't involved in their plan.)
uid01021cca.msg:006d:0x00002938:0230:38=(He can handle informing the loyalists. I should head back to the barracks and see if there are any updates.)
uid01021cca.msg:0032:0x000029A9:0260:39=What's this, Hajime-san? Are you done for the day?
uid01021cca.msg:001f:0x000029DD:0278:40=No. Tell me, is Nakaoka around?
uid01021cca.msg:0035:0x000029FD:0284:41=Nakaoka-san's in his room upstairs, as far as I know.
uid01021cca.msg:0007:0x00002A33:0290:42=Got it.
uid01021cd1.msg:0062:0x00001AAF:004c:1=(Hm? That's Matsubara, the Fourth Division captain. And is that the Crow, the information broker?)
uid01021cd1.msg:002d:0x00001B13:0064:2=Saito-kun! Unexpected. When did you get here?
uid01021cd1.msg:0008:0x00001B41:0070:3=Hm? Sir?
uid01021cd1.msg:0011:0x00001B51:0088:4=Have you two met?
uid01021cd1.msg:002e:0x00001B63:0094:5=Ah, no. He's got one of those faces. You know.
uid01021cd1.msg:0012:0x00001B92:00a0:6=Am I interrupting?
uid01021cd1.msg:0047:0x00001BA5:00ac:7=Just hold on. Do you know who this man is? He calls himself "the Crow."
uid01021cd1.msg:0012:0x00001BED:00b8:8=You recognize him?
uid01021cd1.msg:004d:0x00001C07:00d0:9=A, uh, misunderstanding. I'm in the way here. How about I just take my leave?
uid01021cd1.msg:0014:0x00001C55:00dc:10=If you'll excuse me.
uid01021cd1.msg:0005:0x00001C6B:00f4:11=Stop.
uid01021cd1.msg:0004:0x00001C71:0100:12=Huh?
uid01021cd1.msg:0005:0x00001C76:010c:13=Ahhh!
uid01021cd1.msg:001a:0x00001C7D:0124:14=What!? What are you doing?
uid01021cd1.msg:0019:0x00001C98:0130:15=Calm yourself, Saito-kun.
uid01021cd1.msg:000e:0x00001CB2:013c:16=What the hell?
uid01021cd1.msg:0069:0x00001CC1:0148:17=If this informant knew your face, then I expect he knew much more than that. He certainly did in my case.
uid01021cd1.msg:0084:0x00001D2B:0154:18=There are things in this world you don't want me knowing, and things I don't want you knowing. Now we can both rest a little easier.
uid01021cd1.msg:006f:0x00001DB7:016c:19=Don't blame me—you involved yourself. He'd still be breathing right now, had you not walked down this street.
uid01021cd1.msg:0047:0x00001E27:0178:20="Ignorance is bliss." Now come on, the both of us have somewhere to be.
uid01021cd1.msg:0053:0x00001E6F:0184:21=You go ahead. I'd prefer not to travel with someone who'd kill to keep his secrets.
uid01021cd1.msg:0039:0x00001EC3:0190:22=And so you know, there's nothing that I'm trying to hide.
uid01021cd1.msg:0044:0x00001EFD:019c:23=Heh. You should thank me for giving you the chance to tell that lie.
uid01021cd1.msg:0048:0x00001F49:01b4:24=I'm off to the barracks to rest up for tonight. Don't stay out too long.
uid01021cd1.msg:0053:0x00001F92:01c0:25=You and I have forty more men to slay. I would hate to see you tire out. Till then.
uid01021cd1.msg:006c:0x00001FF2:0214:26=(Matsubara... That bastard must really be hiding something. No choice but to head back to the barracks now.)
uid01021cd6.msg:0015:0x000026BE:0060:1=Over here, Saito-kun.
uid01021cd6.msg:000a:0x000026D7:0090:2=Who is he?
uid01021cd6.msg:002f:0x000026E2:009c:3=Ya can't guess? Our new pal, Furutaka Shuntaro.
uid01021cd6.msg:0028:0x00002712:00a8:4=He's a riot. Hajime-chan, you have a go.
uid01021cd6.msg:0014:0x0000273B:00b4:5=P-Please... No more.
uid01021cd6.msg:0051:0x00002750:00c0:6=Indulge me once again, Furutaka. Tell Saito-kun here what you've been telling us.
uid01021cd6.msg:003e:0x000027A2:00cc:7=Ah... The number of people involved? There are at least forty.
uid01021cd6.msg:005e:0x000027E1:00d8:8=The most dangerous ones are... Yoshida Toshimaro... and the man from Choshu... Katsura Kogoro.
uid01021cd6.msg:003e:0x00002840:00e4:9=Yoshida, I dunno. Katsura's a Shindo Munen master, s'pposedly.
uid01021cd6.msg:0068:0x0000287F:00f0:10=Good sword-arm an' speedy. Matter fact—he's so fast, he's famous. Got a funny name. "Slippery Kogoro."
uid01021cd6.msg:0067:0x000028E8:00fc:11=Over in Choshu, they consider him a genius. It's likely that he's the real mastermind behind this plan.
uid01021cd6.msg:003e:0x00002950:0108:12=Ideally, we'll take him alive. But do not allow him to escape.
uid01021cd6.msg:0011:0x0000298F:0114:13=Yeah. Understood.
uid01021cd6.msg:0062:0x000029A1:0120:14=Also, Katsura and Yoshida both—they're only to be engaged by the captains standing in this room.
uid01021cd6.msg:0033:0x00002A04:012c:15=It would be a waste of bodies to send the infantry.
uid01021cd6.msg:001d:0x00002A38:0138:16=Ya ain't gotta tell me twice!
uid01021cd6.msg:005a:0x00002A56:0144:17=Now c'mon, we doin' this yet? I'm feelin' antsy. Like my body knows it's almost kill time.
uid01021cd6.msg:0031:0x00002AB1:0150:18=Yeah. Let's move, Hijikata-han. Sun's goin' down.
uid01021cd6.msg:0067:0x00002AE3:015c:19=We're ready. However, if the Shinsengumi mobilizes en masse it could give us away. Let's remain covert.
uid01021cd6.msg:005b:0x00002B4B:0168:20=Exit the barracks one at a time. Head directly to your destination and stand by. All right?
uid01021cd6.msg:000a:0x00002BA9:018c:21=Saito-kun.
uid01021cd6.msg:000f:0x00002BB5:01a4:22=What is it now?
uid01021cd6.msg:0033:0x00002BC5:01b0:23=Heh, don't be so tense. The deputy chief wants you.
uid01021cd6.msg:001a:0x00002BF9:01bc:24=Meet him in the warehouse.
uid01021cd6.msg:0056:0x00002C14:01c8:25=(Hijikata is waiting for me. The warehouse... That's toward the back of the barracks.)
uid01021cd6.msg:0032:0x00002C6F:0204:26=There you are, Saito-kun. Good timing, I need you.
uid01021cd6.msg:0009:0x00002CA2:0210:27=For what?
uid01021cd6.msg:0067:0x00002CAC:021c:28=The loyalist base that we've been looking for? The inspector's narrowed it down to two possibilities...
uid01021cd6.msg:0055:0x00002D14:0228:29=Ikedaya and Shikokuya. They're both inns. The meeting will take place in one of them.
uid01021cd6.msg:0006:0x00002D6A:0234:30=I see.
uid01021cd6.msg:004d:0x00002D71:0240:31=To get eyes on both, we're going to assemble our men into two separate units.
uid01021cd6.msg:0032:0x00002DBF:024c:32=You and the Third Division will be coming with me.
uid01021cd6.msg:0006:0x00002DF2:0258:33=Right.
uid01021cd6.msg:005c:0x00002DF9:0264:34=As I said, it'll be one of the two, Ikedaya or Shikokuya. Which do you think we should take?
uid01021cd6.msg:000a:0x00002E57:027c:35=Shikokuya.
uid01021cd6.msg:004d:0x00002E62:0288:36=Good, then. In that case, Saito-kun, you and I will handle Shikokuya tonight.
uid01021cd6.msg:004f:0x00002EB0:0294:37=An' that puts <i>me</i>... at Ikedaya. Meh, one ain't no better than the other.
uid01021cd6.msg:0039:0x00002F01:02ac:38=Either would be fine. Is that all that you wanted me for?
uid01021cd6.msg:007b:0x00002F3B:02b8:39=Yes—but, Saito-kun, stay in the barracks for the time being. You need to be ready for when we head to the inn. All right?
uid01021cd6.msg:0055:0x00002FBC:0300:40=(Leaving the barracks again will make me look suspicious. I'll stick around for now.)
uid01021ce5.msg:000a:0x00002AF5:0074:1=Saito-kun.
uid01021ce5.msg:0039:0x00002B01:008c:2=Just now, I sent a spy to Shikokuya to surveil the place.
uid01021ce5.msg:0037:0x00002B3B:0098:3=When the shishi assemble there, he'll give us a signal.
uid01021ce5.msg:007b:0x00002B73:00a4:4=That's if we're at the right inn... If the loyalists are based at Ikedaya, then we'll rendezvous there as fast as possible.
uid01021ce5.msg:0010:0x00002BEF:00b0:5=Right. I got it.
uid01021ce5.msg:0052:0x00002C00:00bc:6=Hm. You seem quite untroubled by things. I suppose you're no stranger to all this.
uid01021ce5.msg:0030:0x00002C5A:00d4:7=I'm curious... Matsubara and you have any words?
uid01021ce5.msg:001b:0x00002C8B:00e0:8=Why are you asking me that?
uid01021ce5.msg:0058:0x00002CA7:00ec:9=Just... Matsubara suddenly started questioning me about you earlier. It was conspicuous.
uid01021ce5.msg:004d:0x00002D07:0104:10=Fine. I'll ask you something else. Tell me, why did you join the Shinsengumi?
uid01021ce5.msg:0038:0x00002D55:0110:11=Shouldn't you have asked me that when I first showed up?
uid01021ce5.msg:0033:0x00002D8E:011c:12=A fair point. Remind me and I'll do that next time.
uid01021ce5.msg:003d:0x00002DC2:0128:13=I had no reason. There was just nowhere else that I could go.
uid01021ce5.msg:0064:0x00002E00:0134:14=Is that so? Your skills are impressive. One look and any of the loyalist parties would have had you.
uid01021ce5.msg:0052:0x00002E65:0140:15=A loyalist or a Bakufu mongrel, no difference. I'll go wherever I have some value.
uid01021ce5.msg:0066:0x00002EB8:014c:16=Hm, I understand. You certainly keep things simple. Actually, though, I know where you're coming from.
uid01021ce5.msg:0003:0x00002F1F:0158:17=Hm?
uid01021ce5.msg:0058:0x00002F23:0164:18=I'm not sure if you've heard. I was born to a family of farmers. The chief was, as well.
uid01021ce5.msg:0013:0x00002F7C:0170:19=I didn't know that.
uid01021ce5.msg:0063:0x00002F91:0188:20=He and I inherited a 300-year-old destiny. Our fathers and grandfathers never got to wield a sword.
uid01021ce5.msg:003c:0x00002FF5:0194:21=When I was young, I had every expectation of dying a farmer.
uid01021ce5.msg:0030:0x00003039:01ac:22=Then, Black Ships came... and changed the world.
uid01021ce5.msg:005c:0x0000306B:01c4:23=Now times have become uncertain. Real strength counts for more than who your ancestors were.
uid01021ce5.msg:0040:0x000030C8:01d0:24=And a farmer's son like me? Even I have leave to follow a dream.
uid01021ce5.msg:0011:0x00003109:01dc:25=You have a dream?
uid01021ce5.msg:0063:0x0000311B:01e8:26=Kondo Isami has a dream—and now that men like us have our swords, the Shinsengumi will follow it.
uid01021ce5.msg:0016:0x00003180:0200:27=For the Bakufu's sake?
uid01021ce5.msg:0016:0x00003197:020c:28=No. For the country's.
uid01021ce5.msg:0005:0x000031AE:0218:29=What?
uid01021ce5.msg:002d:0x000031B4:0224:30=Someday I'll be able to tell you what I mean.
uid01021ce5.msg:0042:0x000031E3:023c:31=You might not believe it, but I happen to hold you in high esteem.
uid01021ce5.msg:003f:0x00003226:0248:32=For now, I only need you to have faith and trust in my methods.
uid01021ce5.msg:002b:0x00003266:0254:33=So I should stop thinking. Just be a sword.
uid01021ce5.msg:0030:0x00003292:0260:34=Be a warrior. What greater value could you have?
uid01021ce5.msg:0017:0x000032C4:0278:35=I suppose you're right.
uid01021ce5.msg:001f:0x000032DD:0290:36=Hmhm... Mm? Here comes our spy.
uid01021ce5.msg:0021:0x000032FF:02b4:37=Deputy Chief. Shikokuya is quiet.
uid01021ce5.msg:001e:0x00003321:02c0:38=There's no sign of any shishi.
uid01021ce5.msg:0020:0x00003340:02cc:39=So it seems... we chose wrongly.
uid01021ce5.msg:002b:0x00003362:02e4:40=Ikedaya! The shishi meeting—it's Ikedaya!
uid01021ce5.msg:0029:0x0000338E:02f0:41=Hear that? Everyone, Ikedaya! Let's move!
uid01021cee.msg:000c:0x00000D6F:004c:1=Guh... Shit!
uid01021cee.msg:0009:0x00000D7C:0058:2=Nagakura?
uid01021cee.msg:001d:0x00000D86:0064:3=Sa—Saito! I got careless...
uid01021cee.msg:0005:0x00000DA8:00a0:4=Augh!
uid01021cee.msg:001c:0x00000DAE:00ac:5=That's... Yoshida Toshimaro!
uid01021cee.msg:003c:0x00000DCB:00b8:6=Now I see. So this is the man willing to burn the city down.
uid01021cee.msg:0033:0x00000E09:00d0:7=Catch your breath, Nagakura. I can handle this one.
uid01021cf5.msg:0044:0x00001529:0034:1=Well, well, Katsu-sensei... Bakufu bigwig like you slinkin' in here?
uid01021cf5.msg:002f:0x0000156E:0040:2=Gonna retire from the navy an' move ta Satsuma?
uid01021cf5.msg:0048:0x0000159E:004c:3=I didn't come to discuss my retirement plans, edifying as that would be.
uid01021cf5.msg:004c:0x000015E7:0058:4=I'm here because right now, the Satsuma military seems led by a potato sack.
uid01021cf5.msg:0025:0x00001635:0070:5=Heh. Same as ya ever were, Katsu-han.
uid01021cf5.msg:004d:0x0000165B:007c:6=The feckless idealists of Choshu will never threaten the Bakufu on their own.
uid01021cf5.msg:0034:0x000016A9:0088:7=They need Satsuma's army to bring about real change.
uid01021cf5.msg:0040:0x000016DE:0094:8=Wonder if the Bakufu'd take kindly ta whatcher sayin' right now.
uid01021cf5.msg:005b:0x0000171F:00a0:9=Don't play games with me. At this point, you should be well aware whose side I'm really on.
uid01021cf5.msg:0019:0x0000177B:00ac:10=Eh, could hazard a guess.
uid01021cf5.msg:006c:0x00001795:00b8:11=I went to my superiors—pled to them to build a nation strong as the foreigners'. They ignored my concerns.
uid01021cf5.msg:0052:0x00001802:00c4:12=Therefore, I've taken matters into my own hands. The Bakufu will fall from within.
uid01021cf5.msg:0006:0x00001855:00d0:13=Huh...
uid01021cf5.msg:004b:0x0000185C:00dc:14=Join me, Saigo. I'll destabilize the interior, you'll engage their defense.
uid01021cf5.msg:002c:0x000018A8:00e8:15=Ya want me to declare war... that'cher plan?
uid01021cf5.msg:0032:0x000018D5:00f4:16=Yes. Go to war and win. The country will be yours.
uid01021cf5.msg:0012:0x00001908:0100:17=Hardly a bad deal.
uid01021cf5.msg:0043:0x00001922:0118:18=I've brought something—as a show of good faith. A weapon for you.
uid01021cf5.msg:0009:0x00001966:0124:19=A weapon?
uid01021cf5.msg:003c:0x00001970:0130:20=He's forged considerable inroads with the British merchants.
uid01021cf5.msg:0050:0x000019AD:013c:21=Think of it. Edo Castle would fall in a day to the artillery they could provide.
uid01021cf5.msg:0027:0x00001A05:0154:22=The Tosan expatriate... Sakamoto Ryoma.
uid01021cf5.msg:0012:0x00001A2D:0160:23=Sakamoto... Ryoma?
uid01021cfb.msg:001b:0x00001802:0040:1=Going back to the barracks?
uid01021cfb.msg:001e:0x0000181E:004c:2=Yeah. Was there anything else?
uid01021cfb.msg:001b:0x0000183D:0058:3=One thing still bothers me.
uid01021cfb.msg:000b:0x00001859:0064:4=What is it?
uid01021cfb.msg:003a:0x00001865:0070:5=Something that Katsura Kogoro mentioned to you at Ikedaya.
uid01021cfb.msg:0039:0x000018A0:007c:6=He said... Takechi himself revealed your identity to him.
uid01021cfb.msg:0005:0x000018DA:0088:7=Yeah.
uid01021cfb.msg:0055:0x000018E1:00a0:8=Makes me worry. Katsura could leak your real name to the Shinsengumi at any time now.
uid01021cfb.msg:000d:0x00001937:00ac:9=Why would he?
uid01021cfb.msg:004c:0x00001945:00b8:10=Slippery or not, he's from Choshu. No one there has any love for the Wolves.
uid01021cfb.msg:0063:0x00001992:00c4:11=If the Third Division captain were outed as a brother to the head loyalist, there'd be hell to pay.
uid01021cfb.msg:0036:0x000019F6:00d0:12=After everything that happened, he'd still give me up?
uid01021cfb.msg:0056:0x00001A2D:00dc:13=You could follow Matsubara to the chopping block, and leave another division headless.
uid01021cfb.msg:003e:0x00001A84:00e8:14=For him, the fewer Shinsengumi captains there are, the better.
uid01021cfb.msg:004b:0x00001AC3:00f4:15=Katsura didn't strike me as someone who'd resort to those kinds of tactics.
uid01021cfb.msg:000f:0x00001B0F:0100:16=All the same...
uid01021cfb.msg:0056:0x00001B1F:010c:17=It doesn't matter what he knows. My days with the Shinsengumi are numbered regardless.
uid01021cfb.msg:0011:0x00001B76:0118:18=What do you mean?
uid01021cfb.msg:0044:0x00001B88:0124:19=My search for Tennen Rishin users? Every captain knows about it now.
uid01021cfb.msg:0010:0x00001BCD:0130:20=Ah, that's true.
uid01021cfb.msg:003e:0x00001BDE:013c:21=For the time being, the Shinsengumi has more use for me alive.
uid01021cfb.msg:0052:0x00001C1D:0148:22=Once they decide that's not the case, they'll silence me like every other traitor.
uid01021cfb.msg:0039:0x00001C70:0154:23=So you need to make the most of what time you have there.
uid01021cfb.msg:0043:0x00001CAA:0160:24=Even if I have to take risks, I've got to find the masked man soon.
uid01021cfb.msg:0050:0x00001CEE:016c:25=The Shinsengumi is still my only way forward. I just need to get close to him...
uid01021cfb.msg:0037:0x00001D3F:0178:26=Kondo Isami, you mean? You've still never seen the man?
uid01021cfb.msg:0024:0x00001D77:0184:27=Yeah, he hasn't shown his face once.
uid01021cfb.msg:0055:0x00001D9C:0190:28=Can I take it he's your number one suspect? Think he's the man that killed Toyo-sama?
uid01021cfb.msg:0057:0x00001DF2:019c:29=I don't know. Even if he isn't, though, Kondo might be the only one that knows who did.
uid01021cfb.msg:0035:0x00001E4A:01a8:30=Ah... Every Tennen Rishin swordsman came through him.
uid01021cfb.msg:0040:0x00001E80:01b4:31=He won't stay hidden. Sooner or later, the chief has to show up.
uid01021cfb.msg:0046:0x00001EC1:01c0:32=So, I'm going to the barracks. I can't let a single opportunity go by.
uid01021cff.msg:0069:0x00000100:0028:1=(I need to figure out a way to meet Kondo... Even if he's not there, the barracks are still my best bet.)
uid01021d00.msg:003a:0x00000F11:0034:1=Enough fuckin' around! Get Kondo's ass out here right now!
uid01021d00.msg:0017:0x00000F4D:004c:2=Saito-kun, come inside.
uid01021d00.msg:0022:0x00000F6D:0070:3=You kiddin'!? Let us in too, then!
uid01021d00.msg:0042:0x00000F90:007c:4=The chief is unavailable. I'm afraid he's very busy at the moment.
uid01021d00.msg:002f:0x00000FD3:0088:5=What's with this idiot? We're the Mimawarigumi!
uid01021d00.msg:002c:0x00001003:0094:6=Ronin like you got no right turnin' us away!
uid01021d00.msg:0074:0x00001031:00ac:7=Sasaki-san, if you want to stand there and bark like a man who deserves respect, you should do something to earn it.

uid01021d0a.msg:0085:0x00005598:0110:12=Takechi Hanpeita himself named him the Tosa Loyalist Party's rep. A year ago, he killed Magistrate Yoshida Toyo and committed dappan.

uid01021d0a.msg:0028:0x00005668:0140:16=No. It's fine. So, where should I start?
uid01021d0a.msg:0061:0x00005691:014c:17=Sakamoto Ryoma was last seen a few days ago. Reports have him entering the Kyo-Satsuma Consulate.
uid01021d0a.msg:003b:0x000056F3:0158:18=The Satsuma Consulate? What's "Sakamoto Ryoma" doing there?

uid01021d0a.msg:0063:0x00005753:017c:21=In any case, after he fled his home, a Bakufu admiral called Katsu Rintaro took him under his wing.

uid01021d0a.msg:0058:0x000057C3:0194:23=Gave him a ship, too. It's based in Nagasaki and he's using it to buy British munitions.

uid01021d0a.msg:0026:0x00005843:01ac:25=British munitions? What's he planning?
uid01021d0a.msg:0045:0x0000586A:01b8:26=Heh, the chief wants you to find that out. Try the Satsuma Consulate.
uid01021d0a.msg:0052:0x000058B0:01c4:27=Apparently, Katsu Rintaro brought him there to introduce Saigo Kichinosuke to him.

uid01021d0a.msg:0016:0x00005B3F:02c0:37=Do you need something?
uid01021d0a.msg:0061:0x00005B56:02cc:38=To be honest, I'd like to meet the chief. As far as I know, I'm the only captain that hasn't yet.

uid01021d0a.msg:0027:0x00005BC6:02e4:40=I just thought I could pay my respects.

uid01021d0a.msg:0030:0x00005C64:0314:44=Is there something you need to discuss with him?
uid01021d0a.msg:0027:0x00005C96:032c:45=I need a reason to meet my own comrade?
uid01021d0a.msg:0068:0x00005CBE:0338:46=Of course. This isn't someone you can summon like a housemaid. Think of him as the Shinsengumi's master.
uid01021d0a.msg:0025:0x00005D27:0344:47=...That makes him <i>your</i> master.
uid01021d0a.msg:0017:0x00005D54:035c:48=Do I make myself clear?

uid01021d0a.msg:002d:0x00005DE3:0410:52=Oh? That's the chief's room beyond that door.
uid01021d0a.msg:002c:0x00005E18:0428:53=As I said outside, the chief is unavailable.
uid01021d0a.msg:002b:0x00005E45:0434:54=So then... what can I do to meet the chief?
uid01021d0a.msg:0023:0x00005E71:0440:55=He'll come to you if you're needed.
uid01021d0a.msg:0039:0x00005E95:044c:56=You can ask anyone else here. They'll say the same thing.
uid01021d0a.msg:0022:0x00005ECF:0458:57=("The chief is unavailable," huh?)
uid01021d0a.msg:0064:0x00005EF2:0464:58=(How can I get in contact with Kondo? Maybe there's someone close to him that I can ask for help...)

uid01021d0a.msg:0053:0x0000622E:0560:75=Ya don't owe me nothin'. Tell ya the truth... I'm jus' tired of us killin' our own.
uid01021d0a.msg:0041:0x00006282:056c:76=You mean... what you were telling me about before? Serizawa Kamo?

uid01021d0a.msg:003d:0x000062D9:0590:79=You said that he was a chief. Why would his own men kill him?
uid01021d0a.msg:0067:0x00006317:059c:80=It was... 'fore we called ourselves Shinsengumi. When we first started out, the name was Miburoshigumi.

uid01021d0a.msg:003f:0x000064DD:05e4:85=Kamo-san, though—he was a damn good swordsman. Educated, too.
uid01021d0a.msg:0077:0x0000651D:05f0:86='Side from the chief himself, Kamo-san was the only guy who coulda led a group like this. That's why he brought him on.

uid01021d0a.msg:004b:0x00006749:0650:94=I got a reason. Chief Kondo is why. Without him I wouldn't be the man I am.
uid01021d0a.msg:0048:0x00006795:065c:95=Long time ago, I killed someone by mistake. The chief looked out fer me.
uid01021d0a.msg:004e:0x000067DE:0668:96=I figure... so long as I can help make Kondo-san's dream come true, I'm happy.

uid01021d0a.msg:004d:0x00006916:06b0:102=Deepest part of the compound. Don't think you'll find anyone there right now.

uid01021d1d.msg:0029:0x00001A9B:00c4:10=So, why would someone be using your name?
uid01021d1d.msg:003f:0x00001AC5:00d0:11=I don't know. It could be that somebody is trying to set me up.
uid01021d1d.msg:002e:0x00001B05:00dc:12=The Shinsengumi are going after him, you said?
uid01021d1d.msg:005c:0x00001B34:00e8:13=Yeah. I was told to dig up anything I can about him. Kondo Isami requested me, specifically.
uid01021d1d.msg:0045:0x00001B91:00f4:14=He did? Hold on a minute. Doesn't that mean he must know who you are?
uid01021d1d.msg:0086:0x00001BD7:0100:15=If it was Kondo, a year ago, under the mask? He might remember my face. Maybe he's trying to put me in a position to give myself away.

uid01021d1d.msg:006a:0x00001F13:019c:28=But the Bakufu might be Satsuma's next target, and every other loyalist would have to fall in line, if so.
uid01021d1d.msg:001d:0x00001F7E:01a8:29=Saigo's thought this through.
uid01021d1d.msg:0066:0x00001F9C:01b4:30=On the other hand, Choshu is mostly radical idealists... and they mix with Satsuma like oil and water.

uid01021d35.msg:0030:0x00002E04:00ac:11=Ah... Why, moving the capital. Abandoning Kyo...
uid01021d35.msg:0016:0x00002E35:00b8:12=And relocating to Edo.
uid01021d35.msg:0026:0x00002E4C:00c4:13=Edo? You want to make Edo the capital?
uid01021d35.msg:003b:0x00002E73:00d0:14=Heheh, pretty ambitious, no? But I swear I'm being serious.
uid01021d35.msg:004e:0x00002EAF:00dc:15=I believe... this is the one and only path we have to finally save our nation.

uid01021d35.msg:005f:0x000030D1:0130:21=Just so. But to do that... Kyo must fall. The city has to burn and the Imperial Court must die.
uid01021d35.msg:0058:0x00003131:013c:22=What!? So then, your plan's no different from the group we had to put down at Ikedaya's.

uid01021d35.msg:007d:0x0000333A:019c:30=Exactly. Kyo is the home of our imperial leaders. But then, we're meant to be led by the Bakufu in Edo? It does your head in!

uid01021d35.msg:0060:0x0000376D:0250:44=You've proven your worth to us. And if you still have doubts, there's something I can offer you.

uid01021db5.msg:0063:0x0000414B:029c:36=You Shinsengumi folks... where's the camaraderie between ya? Like, what's his name—Serizawa Kamo?
uid01021db5.msg:0022:0x000041B6:02b4:37=Killed by his own people, I heard?
uid01021db5.msg:005c:0x000041D9:02c0:38=Though I guess the crazy bastard was a firestarter. Is it true he shot a cannon off in town?
uid01021db5.msg:0035:0x00004236:02cc:39=In that case, ya probably made the right call on him!
uid01021db5.msg:002f:0x0000426C:02d8:40=Sengoku-han. Don't believe everything you hear.
uid01021db5.msg:0050:0x0000429C:02e4:41=Haha! That's for sure! Word on the street was that yer a real looker, Okita-han!
uid01021db5.msg:002b:0x000042ED:02f0:42=Huh!? Ya sayin' you don't think I'm pretty?
uid01021db5.msg:0085:0x00004319:02fc:43=Uh! No, don't get me wrong! Eheh, yer pretty, Okita-han! But about that other thing—the Bakufu could use me! I'm a great middleman.
uid01021db5.msg:0043:0x0000439F:0308:44=Seriously? You sold out the loyalists... to get in with the Bakufu?
uid01021db5.msg:002b:0x000043E3:0314:45=Haha! Ya almost got it, but that's not all.
uid01021db5.msg:0051:0x0000440F:0320:46=I didn't just sell out a bunch of shishi... I sold you out too, Saito Hajime-han!
uid01021db5.msg:0005:0x00004461:032c:47=What?
uid01021db5.msg:0039:0x00004467:0338:48=Hey, Okita-han, you ever gonna let the cat outta the bag?
uid01021db5.msg:003d:0x000044A1:0344:49=I'm dyin' to know! Why'd ya ask me to lure this guy out here?
uid01021db5.msg:0034:0x000044E0:035c:50=Ya really can waggle that tongue of yours, can'tcha?
uid01021db5.msg:000f:0x00004515:0368:51=O... Okita-han?
uid01021db5.msg:0004:0x00004526:0380:52=Huh?
uid01021db5.msg:0006:0x0000452B:038c:53=Okita!
uid01021db5.msg:0017:0x00004532:0398:54=How 'bout you shuddup!?
uid01021db5.msg:0015:0x0000454A:03a4:55=Haaah!!! Wh—What...
uid01021db5.msg:000b:0x00004560:03b0:56=Okita, why?
uid01021db5.msg:002a:0x0000456C:03bc:57=Ain't ya been told? Nobody brings up Kamo.
uid01021db5.msg:0033:0x00004597:03c8:58=Shinsengumi's unspoken law. Had no choice, ya know?
uid01021db5.msg:0055:0x000045D2:03e0:59=Now then, Sengoku-han did have one good question. If yer curious, I could fill ya in.
uid01021db5.msg:0030:0x00004628:03ec:60=Why're you here? I'll tell ya, if ya ask nicely.
uid01021dbc.msg:000b:0x00000ACD:0034:1=Hajime-san!
uid01021dbc.msg:0022:0x00000AD9:0040:2=Oryo? What are you doing out here?
uid01021dbc.msg:0038:0x00000AFC:004c:3=I was... told to give you this... It's from Nakaoka-san!
uid01021dbc.msg:0009:0x00000B36:0064:4=A letter?
uid01021dbc.msg:000f:0x00000B41:007c:5=What the hell!?
uid01021dbc.msg:000c:0x00000B58:0094:6=Hajime-chan?
uid01021dbc.msg:000c:0x00000B65:00a0:7=It can't be!
uid01021dbc.msg:000b:0x00000B72:00ac:8=Hajime-san?
uid01021dbc.msg:0018:0x00000B7E:00b8:9=My brother... He's dead.
uid01021dc1.msg:0029:0x000000E0:0028:1=(I'd better head over to the barracks...)
uid01021dc2.msg:001f:0x000006C2:0040:1=Saito! Where the hell ya been!?
uid01021dc2.msg:000b:0x000006E2:004c:2=What is it?
uid01021dc2.msg:0042:0x000006EE:0058:3=Really now? Hang on, ya seriously haven't heard about Gen-san yet?
uid01021dc2.msg:0017:0x00000731:0064:4=What happened to Inoue?
uid01021dc2.msg:0031:0x00000749:0070:5=Well... Just go to the barracks. See for yerself.
uid01021dc6.msg:002b:0x000039B4:0038:1=That fucker! What the hell is his problem!?
uid01021dc6.msg:0051:0x000039E0:0044:2=Sir! How can you let him get away with that!? It was too far, even for Okita-san!
uid01021dc6.msg:0061:0x00003A32:0050:3=Just take it easy, Sanosuke-san. We all know there's no stopping Okita-san when he gets that way.
uid01021dc6.msg:006e:0x00003A94:005c:4=I've fucking had it with the disrespect! From here on, the Tenth Division's taking matters into its own hands!
uid01021dc6.msg:0050:0x00003B04:0074:5=*sigh* This has really become quite the mess. Any plans on what to do next, Sir?
uid01021dc6.msg:005b:0x00003B55:0080:6=With those two rampaging across the city, people might start questioning all of our sanity.
uid01021dc6.msg:001b:0x00003BB1:008c:7=We'll have to go stop them.
uid01021dc6.msg:0016:0x00003BCD:0098:8=Stop them how, though?
uid01021dc6.msg:0056:0x00003BE4:00a4:9=Saito-kun, I want you pursuing Okita. Carefully—there's no telling what he might do.
uid01021dc6.msg:0027:0x00003C3B:00b0:10=Looks like I'm getting the worst of it.
uid01021dc6.msg:0024:0x00003C63:00bc:11=And what do we do with Sanosuke-san?
uid01021dc6.msg:0052:0x00003C88:00c8:12=He'll be easy. Unlike Soji, he doesn't bear any ill will towards Gen-san's killer.
uid01021dc6.msg:003c:0x00003CDB:00d4:13=Just get him good and drunk and he'll blow off enough steam.
uid01021dc6.msg:0025:0x00003D18:00e0:14=So, get him drunk and put him to bed?
uid01021dc6.msg:001d:0x00003D3E:00ec:15=Sound simple enough, Heisuke?
uid01021dc6.msg:0039:0x00003D5C:00f8:16=Sure, just so long as the Shinsengumi's footing the bill.
uid01021dc6.msg:000a:0x00003D96:0104:17=Of course.
uid01021dc6.msg:0004:0x00003DA1:0110:18=Sir.
uid01021dc6.msg:0018:0x00003DA7:0128:19=I still have a question.
uid01021dc6.msg:000c:0x00003DC0:0134:20=What's that?
uid01021dc6.msg:0029:0x00003DCD:0140:21=Why does Okita seem so invested in Inoue?
uid01021dc6.msg:003d:0x00003DF7:014c:22=Well, they knew each other ever since training at Shieikan...
uid01021dc6.msg:005a:0x00003E35:0158:23=Same goes for Yamanami Keisuke—except Okita reacted very differently when Yamanami died.
uid01021dc6.msg:0037:0x00003E90:0164:24=Did Inoue and Okita have some sort of history together?
uid01021dc6.msg:002d:0x00003EC8:0170:25=A history... Yes, I suppose that's quite apt.
uid01021dc6.msg:0019:0x00003EF6:017c:26=Can you tell me about it?
uid01021dc6.msg:0036:0x00003F10:0188:27=Heh, I think that's a question better suited for Soji.
uid01021dc6.msg:0052:0x00003F47:0194:28=Perhaps it will even bring you closer to the answer of your Tennen Rishin mystery.
uid01021dc6.msg:0069:0x00003FA1:01ac:29=All the more reason for you to find him. He's probably headed to the spot where Gen-san's body washed up.
uid01021dc6.msg:0021:0x0000400B:01b8:30=Makes sense. Where would that be?
uid01021dc6.msg:002d:0x0000402D:01c4:31=The harbor at South Yashikimachi, in Fushimi.
uid01021dc6.msg:0062:0x0000405B:01d0:32=Do be cautious, Saito-kun. Getting in Soji's way when he's this angry could be considered suicide.
uid01021dc6.msg:0006:0x000040CC:023c:33=Saito.
uid01021dc6.msg:0008:0x000040D3:0248:34=Inoue...
uid01021dc6.msg:000e:0x000040DD:0260:35=What happened?
uid01021dc6.msg:0069:0x000040EC:026c:36=He was shot twice in the chest... then took a fatal blow from a sword. They dumped his body in the river.
uid01021dc6.msg:0028:0x00004156:0278:37=It was most likely the loyalists' doing.
uid01021dc6.msg:001d:0x0000417F:0284:38=Yes... That stands to reason.
uid01021dc6.msg:0099:0x0000419D:0290:39=Hmph... How many times had I said the old man should just retire? Even his own officers were starting to say he was getting rusty, when he wasn't around.
uid01021dc6.msg:0052:0x0000423E:02a8:40=Those rumors are baseless. In truth, Gen-san was nearly unparalleled with a sword.
uid01021dc6.msg:005c:0x00004291:02b4:41=It's much more likely that he was caught off-guard and was unable to defend himself in time.
uid01021dc6.msg:0041:0x000042EE:02c0:42=You think so? Then maybe we should be looking to recruit the guy.
uid01021dc6.msg:0068:0x00004330:02cc:43=He may have had the armed advantage, but still—he was able to take out the head of the Sixth Division.
uid01021dc6.msg:0073:0x00004399:02d8:44=Tani, then Suzuki, and now Gen-san? Man, I feel sorry for all the troops who've been relying on such weak captains.
uid01021dc6.msg:0025:0x0000440D:02e4:45=Sanosuke-san, isn't that a bit harsh?
uid01021dc6.msg:0025:0x00004433:02f0:46=It's about goddamn time we get harsh!
uid01021dc6.msg:0068:0x00004459:02fc:47=Choshu loyalists are crawling all over this city. We've already lost <i>three</i> more captains to them!
uid01021dc6.msg:0068:0x000044C2:0308:48=And with Yamanami-san and Matsubara gone, too? The Shinsengumi's rep is completely ruined at this point!
uid01021dc6.msg:003f:0x00004532:0320:49=Sir, have you heard what the loyalists are calling us nowadays?
uid01021dc6.msg:0040:0x00004572:032c:50=They say we're pawns. Even they know just how expendable we are.
uid01021dc6.msg:001b:0x000045B4:0344:51=That's what they're saying?
uid01021dc6.msg:008a:0x000045D0:0350:52=Hijikata-san, have you already forgotten? Half a year ago, you told us that joining the Shinsengumi was a clear path to becoming hatamoto.
uid01021dc6.msg:00a5:0x0000465B:035c:53=That's the one reason I came to Kyo—to form an elite crew that'll climb its way to the top. And where are we now? Making captains out of people we don't even know.
uid01021dc6.msg:005a:0x00004708:0374:54=I'm not here because of an emperor, or foreign invaders, or even the state of the country.
uid01021dc6.msg:0048:0x00004763:0380:55=I'm here to get respect, and the Shinsengumi's done nothing but lose it!
uid01021dc6.msg:000b:0x000047AC:038c:56=Sanosuke...
uid01021dc6.msg:0082:0x000047B8:0398:57=I'm done being a pawn. I'm ready to get out there and put some people in fucking checkmate! Please, Sir—I've got to make a move!
uid01021dc6.msg:003f:0x0000483B:03a4:58=You're asking permission to find and bring in Gen-san's killer?
uid01021dc6.msg:003f:0x0000487B:03b0:59=Not at all. Just one guy's nowhere near enough for this slight.
uid01021dc6.msg:0049:0x000048BB:03bc:60=I'm gonna raid every last inn in Kyo and butcher all the loyalist shishi!
uid01021dc6.msg:0077:0x00004905:03c8:61=What? But if you did that, you probably <i>would</i> get Gen-san's killer—and we'd never get to find out why he died!
uid01021dc6.msg:0039:0x0000497D:03d4:62=I told you, I don't give a <i>shit</i> about any of that!
uid01021dc6.msg:0082:0x000049B7:03e0:63=I'm using this dead geezer to finally get off the leash. Nobody can tell us it's not justified, if we're hunting for his murderer.
uid01021dc6.msg:0078:0x00004A3A:03ec:64=We'll wipe out the loyalists, get this city under control... Maybe restore a shred of dignity to the Shinsengumi's name.
uid01021dcf.msg:005c:0x00000100:0028:1=(I need to stop Okita. He's supposed to be at the harbor on South Yashikimachi, in Fushimi.)

uid01021dd0.msg:0005:0x00001244:00b8:10=What?
uid01021dd0.msg:0059:0x0000124A:00c4:11=They appear to have found a suspect in Inoue-san's murder—they're looking for a komuso.
uid01021dd0.msg:000c:0x000012A4:00d0:12=A komuso...?
uid01021dd0.msg:0062:0x000012B1:00dc:13=You've not heard of them? They wear straw baskets on their heads, sometimes play the shakuhachi...
uid01021dd0.msg:0057:0x00001314:00e8:14=No, I know what komuso are—what I'm asking is, how do you know a komuso killed Inoue?
uid01021dd0.msg:0051:0x0000136C:00f4:15=I've yet to learn the details, but Okita-san must have found a lead of some sort.
uid01021dd0.msg:0065:0x000013BE:0100:16=Whatever the case, Ito-san has requested that you quickly put an end to the First Division's rampage.

uid01021dd4.msg:004e:0x0000186C:006c:2=I'm not the one who killed Inoue. It was most likely the other Sakamoto Ryoma.
uid01021dd4.msg:0035:0x000018C2:0084:3=Okita... Was Inoue really the masked man, that night?
uid01021dd4.msg:0042:0x000018F8:0090:4=I got a question for ya first. What'dja think of my Tennen Rishin?

uid01021dd4.msg:002d:0x000019C9:00b4:7=Izzat so? Then I guess I should be tickled...
uid01021dd4.msg:0065:0x000019F7:00c0:8=It means I finally caught up to the old man's level, after all those years of worryin' I never would.
uid01021dd4.msg:0035:0x00001A5D:00cc:9=So, am I getting this right, that he was your master?

uid01021dde.msg:004a:0x0000408D:005c:4=That night, we changed our name from the Miburoshigumi to the Shinsengumi.
uid01021dde.msg:0089:0x000040D8:0068:5=We leaked a rumor that Kamo had been executed for his ruthless acts, and started dressing in flashy blue haori—all to cover our tracks.
uid01021dde.msg:0088:0x00004162:0074:6=Heh, Goro-chan here drew the short straw—since he became Soji, he has to claim to be a pretty-boy like the first Soji was known to be.
uid01021dde.msg:0049:0x000041EB:0080:7=Then, to make sure this secret never left the group, we wrote the code...
uid01021dde.msg:0040:0x00004235:008c:8=Including, all who desert the Shinsengumi shall be put to death.
uid01021dde.msg:0063:0x00004276:0098:9=Exactly. It didn't originally apply to every member, though—just the captains who knew the truth.
uid01021dde.msg:0061:0x000042DA:00a4:10=With one simple and fast rule, we were able to ensure all our mouths stay shut, including my own.
uid01021dde.msg:0010:0x0000433C:00b0:11=So that's why...
uid01021dde.msg:0055:0x0000434D:00bc:12=I just <i>had</i> to get my hands on Kamo-san's Mito Tengu style for the Shinsengumi.
uid01021dde.msg:0065:0x000043A3:00c8:13=The day after he became Gen-san, I had him start training everyone at Shieikan in his fighting style.
uid01021dde.msg:0077:0x00004409:00d4:14=Soon, I decided we'd rename it to the Tennen Rishin style, and try spreading it across Kyo, then the rest of the world.
uid01021dde.msg:004b:0x00004481:00e0:15=The idea was to continually recruit the strongest swordsmen in the country.
uid01021dde.msg:0098:0x000044CD:00ec:16=There may have only been seven of us at first, but our recruitment efforts paid off fast. We started getting members like Sanosuke, Takeda, and Ito-san.
uid01021dde.msg:0054:0x00004566:00f8:17=So, does that make me one of the swordsmen who got picked up to learn Tennen Rishin?
uid01021dde.msg:0068:0x000045BB:0104:18=Yeah—but it certainly seems to have been mutually beneficial, considering the truth you've been after.
uid01021dde.msg:0031:0x00004624:0110:19=Funny how things turn out in life sometimes, huh?
uid01021dde.msg:003c:0x0000465D:0128:20=Ryoma-san, you now know the entire truth of the Shinsengumi.
uid01021dde.msg:006e:0x0000469A:0134:21=The masked man you were chasing... That was Serizawa Kamo, living as Inoue Genzaburo for the rest of his days.
uid01021dde.msg:0047:0x00004710:014c:22=Somethin' tells me ya gave him a pretty guilty conscience, Hajime-chan.
uid01021dde.msg:0076:0x00004758:0158:23=When Matsubara was about to spill the beans on ya, I think Kamo-san cut him down to cover yer ass as a bit of payback.
uid01021dde.msg:0048:0x000047CF:0164:24=Normally, he was never the kinda guy who'd cut someone down from behind.
uid01021dde.msg:0057:0x00004818:0170:25=So Inoue knew exactly who I was, but still helped cover for me with the Shinsengumi...?
uid01021dde.msg:0045:0x00004870:017c:26=Yep, that's Kamo-san. Always tryna make things right, in his own way.
uid01021dde.msg:0025:0x000048BD:0194:27=Well? Anything else you need to hear?
uid01021dde.msg:0054:0x000048E3:01a0:28=Well, there is one thing—I still haven't heard why Inoue-san had to kill Pops yet.
uid01021dde.msg:0074:0x00004938:01ac:29=The order came down from the Mito Domain—said our dappan would only get forgiven if the job went down well enough.
uid01021dde.msg:004c:0x000049AD:01b8:30=It was the Mito Domain? Does that mean whoever wanted Pops dead lives there?
uid01021dde.msg:006a:0x000049FA:01c4:31=I'm fresh outta answers. Kamo-san never said anythin' about it... Just like ya'd expect of a shadowy type.
uid01021dde.msg:0035:0x00004A65:01d0:32=Then... I don't know what to do, without any leads...
uid01021dde.msg:0028:0x00004A9B:01dc:33=Ryoma-san, let me ask you something now.
uid01021dde.msg:0064:0x00004AC4:01e8:34=If you were to find out who had Toyo killed, right this moment, would you go out and hunt them down?
uid01021dde.msg:005c:0x00004B29:01f4:35=I can't say for sure... But I did realize something when I found out who the masked man was.
uid01021dde.msg:000b:0x00004B86:0200:36=That is...?
uid01021dde.msg:0055:0x00004B92:020c:37=I haven't been looking for revenge... I'm just trying to learn the truth. That's all.
uid01021dde.msg:0022:0x00004BE8:0218:38=That's somewhat relieving to hear.
uid01021dde.msg:0043:0x00004C0B:0224:39=And if it's the truth, maybe you really are ready for the answer...
uid01021dde.msg:000f:0x00004C4F:0230:40=Hm? What is it?
uid01021dde.msg:005d:0x00004C5F:023c:41=I knew you were Sakamoto Ryoma because of Kamo-san. He'd ratted you out basically right away.
uid01021dde.msg:003c:0x00004CBD:0248:42=But that wasn't the only thing he told me. I also learned...
uid01021dde.msg:004a:0x00004D01:0260:43=The name of the man who masterminded Toyo's assassination: Sakamoto Ryoma.
uid01021dde.msg:003a:0x00004D4C:026c:44=What!? Wait, you mean... the <i>other</i> Sakamoto Ryoma!?
uid01021dde.msg:0021:0x00004D87:0278:45=Yer talkin' about the komuso one?
uid01021dde.msg:003a:0x00004DA9:0284:46=Yes... and now he's killed Gen-san, his one-time assassin.
uid01021dde.msg:0026:0x00004DE4:0290:47=Probably just to cover his own tracks.
uid01021dde.msg:0011:0x00004E0B:029c:48=That shitstick...
uid01021dde.msg:0067:0x00004E1D:02a8:49=There's more. The inspector recently reported that the other Sakamoto Ryoma's been staying at Teradaya.
uid01021dde.msg:001f:0x00004E85:02b4:50=Really? Has he been there long?
uid01021dde.msg:007d:0x00004EA5:02c0:51=I don't know if he's been there as long as you have, but it certainly sounds like Teradaya's got its fill of Sakamoto Ryomas.
uid01021dde.msg:001d:0x00004F23:02cc:52=Shit keeps gettin' crazier...
uid01021dde.msg:0046:0x00004F41:02d8:53=Apparently he comes and goes from the inn for various lengths of time.
uid01021dde.msg:003c:0x00004F88:02e4:54=It sounds like it's at least one of his major haunts in Kyo.
uid01021dde.msg:0050:0x00004FC5:02f0:55=Also, so you're aware, Ito-san and Takeda's Fifth Division are headed there now.
uid01021dde.msg:0023:0x00005016:02fc:56=You've already put together a raid?
uid01021dde.msg:0078:0x0000503A:0308:57=Those guys couldn't stand up to a single fart from that komuso copycat! The guy took out Serizawa Kamo, fer fuck's sake!
uid01021dde.msg:0032:0x000050B3:0314:58=Yeah... I can't imagine him going down too easily.
uid01021dde.msg:0044:0x000050E6:0320:59=If they let him get away, we might not get another chance like this.
uid01021dde.msg:006c:0x00005132:0338:60=Ryoma-san— Saito-san, rather... I need you to keep playing the captain so you can lend a hand at Teradaya.
uid01021dde.msg:0084:0x0000519F:0344:61=If you don't catch your impostor before Ito or Takeda do, your chances of solving Yoshida Toyo's murder are gonna dry up to nothing.
uid01021dde.msg:000b:0x00005224:0350:62=Understood.
uid01021dde.msg:000c:0x00005232:0374:63=Kondo-san...
uid01021dde.msg:0003:0x0000523F:0380:64=Hm?
uid01021dde.msg:0048:0x00005243:038c:65=Thank you for telling me everything. I'm glad I came to the Shinsengumi.
uid01021dde.msg:0034:0x0000528D:03a4:66=Aw, get outta here. Seriously, before it's too late!
uid01021dde.msg:0006:0x000052C2:03b0:67=Right.
uid01021dde.msg:0050:0x000052CC:03e0:68=Sorry for the hassle. What we're about to share isn't exactly an open-air topic.
uid01021dde.msg:0078:0x0000531D:03ec:69=But hey, at least we can all be straight about the names here, right, Ryoma-san? Kinda nice to have it all on the table.
uid01021dde.msg:0082:0x00005396:03f8:70=In that case, I'll get to the point. What's the mystery behind the Shinsengumi? What's it have to do with the Tennen Rishin style?
uid01021dde.msg:0071:0x00005419:0404:71=It all started around this time last year. Before we came to Kyo, the Shinsengumi was known as the Miburoshigumi.
uid01021dde.msg:0043:0x0000548B:0410:72=Back then, the Miburoshigumi had a second chief, other than myself.
uid01021dde.msg:001e:0x000054CF:041c:73=You mean Serizawa Kamo, right?
uid01021dde.msg:006e:0x000054EE:0428:74=Indeed. He was like a living shadow from the Mito Domain. No one was as feared in the underground as that man.
uid01021dde.msg:0007:0x0000555D:0434:75=Really?
uid01021dde.msg:0065:0x00005565:0440:76=The Miburoshigumi was formed as a Bakufu-appointed organization to protect the Shogun in the capital.
uid01021dde.msg:006e:0x000055CB:044c:77=Out of the Shieikan dojo, seven of us joined up: Hijikata, Yamanami, Okita, Nagakura, Inoue, Todo, and myself.
uid01021dde.msg:006a:0x0000563A:0458:78=However, we also had three founders from the Mito Domain: Serizawa Kamo, Hirayama Goro, and Hirama Jusuke.
uid01021dde.msg:003f:0x000056A5:0464:79=Kamo and Goro—you used those names earlier. Are you saying...
uid01021dde.msg:0056:0x000056E5:0470:80=Now you're getting it. The true Inoue Genzaburo, Okita Soji, and Nagakura Shinpachi...
uid01021dde.msg:0080:0x0000573C:047c:81=All three have been dead for quite some time. Serizawa Kamo, Hirayama Goro, and Hirama Jusuke each took one of their identities.
uid01021dde.msg:0005:0x000057BD:0488:82=What?
uid01021dde.msg:0051:0x000057C3:0494:83=The reason I started here was, all of these details are relevant to Toyo's death.
uid01021dde.msg:0010:0x00005815:04a0:84=And how is that?
uid01021dde.msg:003b:0x00005826:04ac:85=Like I'd said before... It all kicked off about a year ago.
uid01021de5.msg:0022:0x00000100:0028:1=(My impostor... He's at Teradaya!)
uid01021de8.msg:0022:0x00001E19:0034:1=Saito-kun. Didn't expect you here.
uid01021de8.msg:0004:0x00001E3C:0040:2=Ito.
uid01021de8.msg:0069:0x00001E41:004c:3=The guy from Tosa who killed Inoue-san is here—name's Sakamoto Ryoma. We were just about to go get him.
uid01021de8.msg:000d:0x00001EAB:0058:4=Yeah, I know.
uid01021de8.msg:0045:0x00001EB9:0064:5=We don't need the assistance. Takeda's division and I got it covered.
uid01021de8.msg:0005:0x00001EFF:0070:6=What?
uid01021de8.msg:0068:0x00001F05:007c:7=You're too green for this. We can't have another slip-up here, like your stellar performance at Ikedaya.
uid01021de8.msg:000b:0x00001F6E:0088:8=That was...
uid01021de8.msg:005b:0x00001F7A:0094:9=Whatever it was, don't worry yourself here. As advisor, I've got command of this operation.
uid01021de8.msg:002a:0x00001FD6:00a0:10=Nah. The First is gonna take it from here.
uid01021de8.msg:0026:0x00002002:00b8:11=Okita-kun. Isn't this a real meetup...
uid01021de8.msg:006b:0x00002029:00c4:12=Bad news, Ito-han—I was just with the chief, and it sounds like he's got somethin' to bend your ear over.
uid01021de8.msg:0014:0x00002095:00d0:13=Huh? The chief does?
uid01021de8.msg:002a:0x000020AA:00dc:14=Some sorta talk about retirement, I guess.
uid01021de8.msg:002a:0x000020D5:00e8:15=What? Is Chief Kondo planning on retiring?
uid01021de8.msg:0054:0x00002100:00f4:16=He didn't spill any more than that—all I know is he wants ya back at the barracks.
uid01021de8.msg:002a:0x00002155:0100:17=And that I'm the head honcho here tonight.
uid01021de8.msg:0026:0x00002180:010c:18=If you're making this up, Okita-kun...
uid01021de8.msg:0055:0x000021A7:0118:19=I don't think it'd surprise you to find out you'd be setting yourself up for seppuku.
uid01021de8.msg:0010:0x000021FD:0124:20=I know my rules.
uid01021de8.msg:0063:0x0000220E:0130:21=But I also know you should get to steppin', considerin' the Chief's askin' for his lapdog 'n all...
uid01021de8.msg:0006:0x00002272:013c:22=Grr...
uid01021de8.msg:0044:0x00002279:0148:23=I'm heading to the barracks. First Division's taking over from here.
uid01021de8.msg:0010:0x000022C1:0178:24=Thanks for that.
uid01021de8.msg:0086:0x000022D2:0184:25=Everyone under the sun knows Ito wants to be chief. I may've stretched the truth a bit, but Isami-chan should be able to work it fine.
uid01021de8.msg:004f:0x00002359:0190:26=And now the coast is clear. Only you 'n I have the okay to kill Sakamoto Ryoma.
uid01021de8.msg:0034:0x000023A9:019c:27=Good—except, there's one thing we should do first.
uid01021de8.msg:0007:0x000023DE:01a8:28=Wuzzat?
uid01021de8.msg:004a:0x000023E6:01b4:29=I want to let Teradaya's okami and maid get out before we storm the place.
uid01021de8.msg:004a:0x00002431:01c0:30=They've been awfully good to me. I don't want them getting hurt over this.
uid01021de8.msg:005e:0x0000247C:01cc:31=I get where yer comin' from, but how exactly would we do that without blowin' the whole thing?
uid01021de8.msg:0044:0x000024DB:01d8:32=Not sure. If I can get around to the back and signal them somehow...
uid01021de8.msg:0078:0x00002520:01e4:33=Aaare youuu kidding me!? I wanted to bust down the front door and start fuckin' 'em up while they're pissin' themselves!
uid01021de8.msg:0031:0x00002599:01f0:34=Fiiine, we'll go around the <i>stupid</i> back...
uid01021de8.msg:0011:0x000025CB:01fc:35=Anything else...?
uid01021de8.msg:0016:0x000025DD:0208:36=No, that should do it.
uid01021de8.msg:0033:0x000025F4:0214:37=Then let's roll—before ya make this any less fun.
uid01021de9.msg:004e:0x00000392:0040:1=Hm? You thinkin' about a quick dip or somethin'? Really tryna live it up, huh?
uid01021de9.msg:002c:0x000003E1:004c:2=I can hear water—someone must be in there.
uid01021de9.msg:0055:0x0000040E:0058:3=Hajime-chan, why don'tcha peek in there? Maybe it's the Sakamoto Ryoma we're huntin'.
uid01021dee.msg:0058:0x0000056E:0040:1=Damn... Our whole outfit's been wiped out by just these two!? They've gotta be monsters!
uid01021dee.msg:001e:0x000005C7:004c:2=Are you "Sakamoto Ryoma"? Huh?
uid01021dee.msg:0036:0x000005ED:0064:3=Sakamoto-sensei, don't you worry about this dead meat!
uid01021df6.msg:0045:0x000016EA:0040:1=Never expected the Mimawarigumi to jam up our shit, huh, Hajime-chan?
uid01021df6.msg:003b:0x00001737:0058:2=Somethin' up? Ya been pretty damn quiet here, even fer you.
uid01021df6.msg:0021:0x00001774:0070:3=No... I'm fine. It's just that...
uid01021df6.msg:0004:0x00001796:007c:4=Hmm?
uid01021df6.msg:0027:0x0000179B:0088:5=Spinning up some more stories, you two?
uid01021df6.msg:0048:0x000017C5:00ac:6=Oh, hey, Ito-han. And Takeda—even Heisuke! We gettin' a party started?
uid01021df6.msg:0045:0x0000180E:00b8:7=Don't play dumb. I know you made it all up, Kondo planning to retire.
uid01021df6.msg:0033:0x00001854:00c4:8=Huh? I made up <i>what</i>? My memory's not so hot.
uid01021df6.msg:004c:0x00001888:00d0:9=Quit jerking us off! Your bullshit stunt at Teradaya cost us Sakamoto Ryoma!
uid01021df6.msg:0041:0x000018D5:00dc:10=Well if it mattered to ya so much, maybe ya shoulda stuck around.
uid01021df6.msg:0039:0x00001917:00e8:11=Yer the one who follows Ito-han like a puppy, not meee...
uid01021df6.msg:002f:0x00001951:00f4:12=The fuck's that mean!? Watch your goddamn tone!
uid01021df6.msg:005b:0x00001981:0100:13=Okay, let's calm down a bit, Takeda-san. And you know you're just provoking him, Okita-san.
uid01021df6.msg:0026:0x000019DD:010c:14=What the... Whose side ya takin' here?
uid01021df6.msg:0067:0x00001A04:0118:15=I'm not here to take sides—I'm just having more and more trouble comprehending Kondo-san's decisions.
uid01021df6.msg:004f:0x00001A6C:0124:16=I wonder, maybe things could start getting easier for us with Ito-san as chief.
uid01021df6.msg:0011:0x00001ABC:0130:17=Heisuke!? Really?
uid01021df6.msg:003e:0x00001ACE:013c:18=Don't bother, Heisuke. Idiots like him never listen to reason.
uid01021df6.msg:0091:0x00001B0D:0148:19=But get this through your skull, Okita—in the event that I become chief, neither your years in the group or skill with the sword will save you.
uid01021df6.msg:003e:0x00001B9F:0154:20=Anyone who disobeys my orders... will be silenced. Understood?
uid01021df6.msg:0064:0x00001BE5:016c:21=If you don't want to be put down like a mad dog, you should think long and hard about your attitude.
uid01021df6.msg:0009:0x00001C4A:0178:22=Let's go.
uid01021df6.msg:004b:0x00001C59:01c0:23=(I should head back to Teradaya for now. I have some questions for Oryo...)
uid01021dfe.msg:0018:0x00003354:0058:1=Be honest with me, Oryo.
uid01021dfe.msg:002e:0x0000336D:0064:2=Why did you help that Sakamoto Ryoma get away?
uid01021dfe.msg:0049:0x0000339C:0070:3=I just... wanted to help a guest in danger. He could've been killed here.
uid01021dfe.msg:0050:0x000033E6:007c:4=For aiding one of the Shinsengumi's targets, they could've killed you here, too.
uid01021dfe.msg:0056:0x00003437:0088:5=Is this "Sakamoto Ryoma" the type of guest you should do that for? Risk your own life?
uid01021dfe.msg:004f:0x0000348E:0094:6=Of course. I'd do the same for any guest the Shinsengumi might be coming after.
uid01021dfe.msg:0034:0x000034DE:00a0:7=I'd be a failure as a Teradaya employee if I didn't.
uid01021dfe.msg:001a:0x00003513:00ac:8=I see... That makes sense.
uid01021dfe.msg:0004:0x0000352E:00b8:9=Huh?
uid01021dfe.msg:0019:0x00003533:00c4:10=I'll be checking out now.
uid01021dfe.msg:0011:0x0000354D:00d0:11=Huh? You're what?
uid01021dfe.msg:005b:0x0000355F:00dc:12=I'm part of the Shinsengumi you hate so much. My staying here would only be doing you harm.
uid01021dfe.msg:0011:0x000035BB:00e8:13=No, that's not...
uid01021dfe.msg:0016:0x000035CD:00f4:14=Thanks for everything.
uid01021dfe.msg:000d:0x000035E4:0100:15=Hajime-san...
uid01021dfe.msg:0033:0x000035F3:0118:16=Come now, Oryo-chan... Isn't it time to come clean?
uid01021dfe.msg:000c:0x00003627:0124:17=Okami-san...
uid01021dfe.msg:005e:0x00003634:0130:18=I can tell—you've got a secret too, right? Why don't we just get everything out in the open?
uid01021dfe.msg:0018:0x0000369A:0148:19=What do you mean, Otose?
uid01021dfe.msg:005e:0x000036B3:0154:20=The thing about her is, you're the whole reason she's even here at Teradaya. Right, Oryo-chan?
uid01021dfe.msg:0012:0x00003712:0160:21=She's here for me?
uid01021dfe.msg:0045:0x00003725:016c:22=Yep. She asked me to let her take care of a guest named Saito Hajime.
uid01021dfe.msg:005d:0x0000376B:0178:23=At first, I figured maybe she'd just taken a shine to you—but soon, I knew that wasn't all.
uid01021dfe.msg:0073:0x000037C9:0184:24=She'd follow you when you'd leave the inn, and poke around your room as she cleaned it, looking for who knows what.
uid01021dfe.msg:003c:0x0000383D:0190:25=I'd say there's something funny going on, at the very least.
uid01021dfe.msg:0022:0x00003881:01a8:26=Can you explain any of this, Oryo?
uid01021dfe.msg:003a:0x000038A4:01b4:27=It have anything to do with Sakamoto Ryoma-han, Oryo-chan?
uid01021dfe.msg:0073:0x000038E6:01cc:28=You're in love with Hajime-san, aren't you? You want him to stay in your life? Then you need to tell him the truth.
uid01021dfe.msg:004d:0x0000395A:01d8:29=You wouldn't want the love of your life to have any doubts in you, would you?
uid01021dfe.msg:0027:0x000039A9:01f0:30=I understand. I'll tell you everything.
uid01021dfe.msg:0055:0x000039D8:0208:31=This whole time, even before coming here... I've been cooperating with the loyalists.
uid01021dfe.msg:005e:0x00003A2E:0214:32=At first, I just reported whatever little rumors I heard around town to Sakamoto-san's people.
uid01021dfe.msg:0047:0x00003A8D:0220:33=They told me I was helping out the loyalists, and the pay wasn't bad...
uid01021dfe.msg:0065:0x00003ADC:0238:34=It's my mom... She's been too sick to leave her bed for years. I had to pay for her medicine somehow.
uid01021dfe.msg:006b:0x00003B42:0244:35=But one day, someone told me to follow a man named Saito Hajime... and report back with everything he does.
uid01021dfe.msg:001c:0x00003BAE:0250:36=And that was Sakamoto Ryoma?
uid01021dfe.msg:0079:0x00003BD2:0268:37=When and where you were going, who you were meeting... He wanted me to report whatever I could while working at Teradaya.
uid01021dfe.msg:0045:0x00003C4C:0274:38=I admit, I didn't think anything of it. At least, until that night...
uid01021dfe.msg:0046:0x00003C9C:02b0:39=<i>This</i> was left here at Teradaya, the same day I hired Oryo-chan.
uid01021dfe.msg:0055:0x00003CE3:02bc:40=I never considered where it might've come from... but now, I'm thinking Sakamoto-san.
uid01021dfe.msg:0027:0x00003D39:02c8:41=Rewarding me for hiring Oryo as a maid.
uid01021dfe.msg:002c:0x00003D61:02d4:42=How did you meet the man in the first place?
uid01021dfe.msg:003e:0x00003D8E:02e0:43=My father was originally... involved in the loyalist movement.
uid01021dfe.msg:0069:0x00003DCD:02ec:44=Right up until he got caught in a raid and Bakufu officials killed him... what feels like a lifetime ago.
uid01021dfe.msg:005a:0x00003E37:02f8:45=After that, loyalist shishi started coming to our house, so they could pay their respects.
uid01021dfe.msg:0025:0x00003E92:0304:46=Sakamoto-san was one of those people.
uid01021dfe.msg:0049:0x00003EB8:0310:47=He was nice enough to help my family, when we had nowhere else to turn...
uid01021dfe.msg:0083:0x00003F02:031c:48=This might not mean anything to you, Hajime-san, but when samurai start killing, it's the women and children who are hurt the most.
uid01021dfe.msg:0041:0x00003F86:0328:49=Oryo-chan didn't get involved in this mess because she wanted to.
uid01021dfe.msg:0067:0x00003FC8:0334:50=The poor woman simply had to find a way to help her mother. Please don't judge her harshly, Hajime-san.
uid01021dfe.msg:000c:0x00004030:0340:51=Okami-san...
uid01021dfe.msg:0029:0x0000403D:034c:52=Oryo, I just want to know one more thing.
uid01021dfe.msg:007c:0x00004067:0358:53=If Sakamoto Ryoma was using you all this time to keep an eye on me, what made him decide to show up here today, of all days?
uid01021dfe.msg:0031:0x000040E4:0364:54=He had to have known we'd cross paths eventually.
uid01021dfe.msg:0063:0x00004116:0370:55=Sorry, I truly don't know the answer... Sakamoto-san did say he had a job in Kyo to finish, though.
uid01021dfe.msg:001a:0x0000417A:037c:56=But that's all he told me.
uid01021dfe.msg:001a:0x00004195:0388:57=A job in Kyo to finish...?
uid01021dfe.msg:0035:0x000041B0:0394:58=Hajime-san, what are you going to do about Oryo-chan?
uid01021dfe.msg:003f:0x000041E6:03a0:59=Don't worry, Okami-san. I'm ready to accept whatever I deserve.
uid01021dfe.msg:002e:0x00004226:03ac:60=Hajime-san... You probably hate me now, right?
uid01021dfe.msg:0025:0x00004255:03b8:61=No. I don't have any right to be mad.
uid01021dfe.msg:0020:0x0000427B:03c4:62=I have to confess to you both...
uid01021dfe.msg:001c:0x0000429C:03d0:63=I've been using a fake name.
uid01021dfe.msg:0007:0x000042B9:03dc:64=Wha...?
uid01021e04.msg:005d:0x00003AB4:0038:1=(Walking abdication papers right up to the Shogun himself... Even I think this sounds crazy.)
uid01021e04.msg:0047:0x00003B12:0044:2=(Not to mention Yamazaki's death... I should get over to the barracks.)
uid01021e04.msg:0056:0x00003B5B:005c:3=That "Sakamoto Ryoma" is moving closer and closer to starting an anti-Bakufu uprising.
uid01021e04.msg:0023:0x00003BB2:0068:4=Guess that means he's almost ready.
uid01021e04.msg:0027:0x00003BD6:0074:5=What do you mean? Did something happen?
uid01021e04.msg:003d:0x00003BFE:0080:6=Yeah—Saigo of Satsuma and Katsura of Choshu formed a truce.
uid01021e04.msg:005f:0x00003C3C:008c:7=The two biggest loyalist factions went and united in hopes of taking down the Bakufu in secret.
uid01021e04.msg:002b:0x00003C9C:0098:8=So, I guess... they're the Satcho Alliance.
uid01021e04.msg:0017:0x00003CC8:00a4:9=The Satcho Alliance...?
uid01021e04.msg:003a:0x00003CE0:00b0:10=And the man who brokered this deal? Also a Sakamoto Ryoma.
uid01021e04.msg:0049:0x00003D1B:00bc:11=But, in this case... it was the real deal who did it. You made it happen.
uid01021e04.msg:0005:0x00003D65:00c8:12=What?
uid01021e04.msg:0048:0x00003D6B:00d4:13=Although apparently, you were at the bottom of a bottle when you did it.
uid01021e04.msg:0019:0x00003DB4:00e0:14=Wait... Maybe that night?
uid01021e04.msg:0060:0x00003DD1:0110:15=Man, who woulda thought all it took to bury a generational grudge was a night out with the lads?
uid01021e04.msg:0045:0x00003E32:011c:16=That being said—this crazy tale's led us right to the brink of war.
uid01021e04.msg:0023:0x00003E78:0128:17=Which makes you the major catalyst.
uid01021e04.msg:005a:0x00003EA3:0140:18=And now, the <i>other</i> Sakamoto Ryoma has to go and pour oil all over this Satcho fire.
uid01021e04.msg:0007:0x00003EFE:014c:19=How so?
uid01021e04.msg:0089:0x00003F06:0158:20=At this point, he's become a full-fledged arms dealer—I'm talking ridiculous numbers of British weapons, getting shipped to the Satcho.
uid01021e04.msg:0037:0x00003F90:0164:21=Katsura and Saigo are nearly set to take on the Bakufu.
uid01021e04.msg:0051:0x00003FC8:0170:22=It could start at any moment—then, we'll be in a bloodbath to rival Sekigahara.
uid01021e04.msg:0012:0x0000401A:017c:23=So, full-on war...
uid01021e04.msg:006b:0x0000402D:0188:24=Sakamoto Ryoma's going to make an absurd profit on those weapons, all at the expense of the people's blood.
uid01021e04.msg:005d:0x00004099:0194:25=The Western powers that be are probably drooling over the thoughts of the money they'll make.
uid01021e04.msg:0032:0x000040F7:01a0:26=All this means, I have to play my final hand soon.
uid01021e04.msg:0035:0x0000412A:01ac:27=You're saying... you're going through with your plan?
uid01021e04.msg:0068:0x00004160:01b8:28=Yes. I'm going to put an end to the Imperial Court before the entire country is set ablaze in civil war.
uid01021e04.msg:0038:0x000041C9:01c4:29=I'm doing my duty to protect this country from invaders.
uid01021e04.msg:001b:0x00004202:01d0:30=Do you really believe that?
uid01021e04.msg:0050:0x0000421E:01dc:31=How many people would that kill? Not just the samurai—women and children, too.
uid01021e04.msg:0036:0x0000426F:01e8:32=How can you call burning down the country "saving it"?
uid01021e04.msg:008e:0x000042A6:01f4:33=Don't make me repeat myself. If I don't do it, <i>more</i> people will die <i>and</i> the country will become a playground for foreign powers.
uid01021e04.msg:0084:0x00004335:0200:34=You're the one to blame for bringing half of the war's fighters together in the first place. Plus, you let Sakamoto Ryoma escape us!
uid01021e04.msg:0034:0x000043BA:020c:35=There's just no way for us to stop the Alliance now.
uid01021e04.msg:004d:0x000043EF:0218:36=Then what if, instead of stopping the Satcho Alliance, we stopped the Bakufu?
uid01021e04.msg:0011:0x0000443D:0224:37=Stop? The Bakufu?
uid01021e04.msg:0060:0x0000444F:0230:38=Yeah, I mean... if the Bakufu surrendered to the Satcho, there wouldn't be any reason for a war.
uid01021e04.msg:0029:0x000044B0:023c:39=You think the Bakufu will just surrender?
uid01021e04.msg:0038:0x000044DA:0248:40=The Bakufu that's ruled this country for over 300 years?
uid01021e04.msg:0039:0x0000451A:0260:41=Wait. Maybe if... Yeah, I think that could actually work.
uid01021e04.msg:0061:0x00004554:026c:42=Now that they have a real contender against them, the Edo Bakufu might be more willing to listen.
uid01021e04.msg:0051:0x000045B6:0278:43=For example... What if the Tokugawa returned the government to the Emperor first?
uid01021e04.msg:0024:0x00004608:0284:44=Like, restoring power to the throne?
uid01021e04.msg:0037:0x0000462D:0290:45=Yeah... Call it something like the "Great Restoration."
uid01021e04.msg:0070:0x00004665:029c:46=If the Bakufu up and surrenders their power on their own, then the Satcho wouldn't have any reason to go to war.
uid01021e04.msg:004b:0x000046D6:02a8:47=Perhaps we could go to the Shogun in person and talk him into surrendering.
uid01021e04.msg:0025:0x00004722:02b4:48=Is something like that even possible?
uid01021e04.msg:0023:0x00004748:02c0:49=Normally, of course not... Buuut...
uid01021e04.msg:0009:0x0000476C:02cc:50=But what?
uid01021e04.msg:0041:0x00004776:02d8:51=Saito Hajime— No, Sakamoto Ryoma—<i>you</i> might be able to.
uid01021e04.msg:0008:0x000047B8:02e4:52=Hm? Me!?
uid01021e04.msg:0072:0x000047C1:02f0:53=I've watched you long enough to know there's nobody else who has the degree of skill with the blade that you have.
uid01021e04.msg:005c:0x00004834:02fc:54=Not only that, you have a charisma that can persuade even a mad dog like Okita to your side.
uid01021e04.msg:0019:0x00004891:0308:55=What's with the flattery?
uid01021e04.msg:0019:0x000048AB:0314:56=No, no, this is all true.
uid01021e04.msg:0067:0x000048C5:0320:57=If anyone's capable of both infiltrating Edo Castle and convincing the Shogun to abdicate, it'd be you.
uid01021e04.msg:005d:0x0000492D:032c:58=So, Ryoma-san—you wanna lay your life on the line in Edo for the sake of the whole country?
uid01021e04.msg:000e:0x0000498B:0338:59=Me, go to Edo?
uid01021e04.msg:0060:0x0000499A:0344:60=Yeah. Sneak into the castle at night. Of course, they'll kill you on the spot if you're sighted.
uid01021e04.msg:002c:0x000049FB:0350:61=Hard to imagine coming back from this one...
uid01021e04.msg:005d:0x00004A28:035c:62=But this really is the only way we could ever get the Tokugawa to accept a Great Restoration.
uid01021e04.msg:002b:0x00004A86:0368:63=So, I'd have to find the Shogun personally?
uid01021e04.msg:0024:0x00004AB2:0374:64=Well, you started it, you finish it.
uid01021e04.msg:0076:0x00004AD7:0380:65=Besides, if the Shogun actually agreed to return power to the Emperor, the other Sakamoto Ryoma is sure to move on us.
uid01021e04.msg:0012:0x00004B4E:038c:66=How do you figure?
uid01021e04.msg:0041:0x00004B61:0398:67=This guy's bending over backwards to fuel a war for the Satcho...
uid01021e04.msg:0038:0x00004BA3:03a4:68=And war costs big, even if you're just preparing for it.
uid01021e04.msg:0068:0x00004BDC:03b0:69=This other Ryoma's not going to let us just ruin his scheme like that. He's going to take it personally.
uid01021e04.msg:0023:0x00004C4C:03c8:70=Well, I can't force you to do this.
uid01021e04.msg:003b:0x00004C70:03d4:71=I suppose, I can always just go back to my original plan...
uid01021e04.msg:0052:0x00004CAC:03e0:72=But <i>you</i>—you'll lose your chance to flush out the man who stole your name.
uid01021e04.msg:004b:0x00004CFF:03ec:73=You know, I've been to Edo before, but I've never seen the castle up close.
uid01021e04.msg:0031:0x00004D4B:03f8:74=I've always wondered what it looks like in there.
uid01021e04.msg:0042:0x00004D7D:0404:75=Really? I imagine it'll probably be the last thing you ever see...
uid01021e04.msg:0028:0x00004DC0:0410:76=Yeah... I'm ready, however it plays out.
uid01021e04.msg:006c:0x00004DE9:041c:77=Heh, excellent news. Although, a Shinsengumi captain leaving Kyo in the middle of the day is too suspicious.
uid01021e04.msg:003c:0x00004E56:0428:78=It'll be better if you waited the day out, left before dawn.
uid01021e04.msg:0038:0x00004E93:0434:79=For now, just return to the barracks and kill some time.
uid01021e04.msg:003f:0x00004ECC:0440:80=The barracks... Yeah, there's someone I need to talk to anyway.
uid01021e04.msg:0003:0x00004F0C:044c:81=Hm?
uid01021e04.msg:0045:0x00004F10:0458:82=Our inspector, Yamazaki Susumu? Has ties to the other Sakamoto Ryoma.
uid01021e04.msg:0036:0x00004F56:0464:83=I see. Unfortunately... you're a bit late to that one.
uid01021e04.msg:000b:0x00004F8D:0470:84=Why's that?
uid01021e04.msg:003b:0x00004F99:047c:85=Yamazaki was found dead. Murdered in our very own barracks.
uid01021e04.msg:0006:0x00004FD5:0488:86=What!?
uid01021e04.msg:004d:0x00004FDC:0494:87=I guess learning about his connections was enough to compromise his safety...
uid01021e04.msg:0021:0x0000502A:04a0:88=So Sakamoto Ryoma had him killed.

uid01021e07.msg:0069:0x000014F5:0054:2=(Well, I have bigger things to worry about. I guess I'll go back to Teradaya and wait until it's time...)
uid01021e07.msg:0076:0x0000155F:0060:3=A new recruit candidate has been unlocked. Please speak to the Third Division's Mission Receptionist for more details.
uid01021e07.msg:004b:0x000015E0:009c:4=That's Yamazaki, on the way out. Stabbed through the heart from the behind.
uid01021e07.msg:003e:0x0000162D:00b4:5=Must've crept up on him, late at night... Something like that.
uid01021e07.msg:0072:0x0000166C:00c0:6=No average person could have pulled that off. A guy as wary as Yamazaki? Makes me think it was someone he trusted.
uid01021e07.msg:0030:0x000016DF:00cc:7=So the killer could even be one of the captains?
uid01021e07.msg:0044:0x00001710:00d8:8=Yes, I guess. By the way, what were you up to last night, Saito-san?
uid01021e07.msg:001a:0x00001755:00e4:9=I was staying at Teradaya.
uid01021e07.msg:0031:0x00001770:00f0:10=Hmm, I see... So you couldn't have done it, then.
uid01021e07.msg:0044:0x000017A2:00fc:11=If being a captain makes me a potential suspect, how about yourself?
uid01021e07.msg:0029:0x000017E7:0108:12=Ah, good point. I hadn't thought of that.
uid01021e07.msg:001f:0x00001811:0114:13=Ahaha, you really got me there!
uid01021e07.msg:0035:0x00001840:018c:14=Saito... Did you hear? Inspector Yamazaki was killed.
uid01021e07.msg:0005:0x00001876:0198:15=Yeah.
uid01021e07.msg:007c:0x0000187C:01a4:16=How pathetic is it that we can even get killed in the middle of our own barracks!? Fuck this! The Shinsengumi's such a joke!
uid01021e07.msg:002c:0x000018F9:01b0:17=Yamazaki was killed in the warehouse, right?
uid01021e07.msg:002c:0x00001926:01bc:18=Yeah. Heisuke's investigating the scene now.
uid01021e07.msg:0033:0x00001953:01c8:19=You oughta go and at least offer Yamazaki a prayer.
uid01021e10.msg:0020:0x000011AB:004c:1=Saito-kun. Do you have a moment?
uid01021e10.msg:000b:0x000011CD:0064:2=What is it?
uid01021e10.msg:004c:0x000011D9:0070:3=I know this'll sound odd, coming from me... but how is Kondo-san holding up?
uid01021e10.msg:0004:0x00001226:007c:4=Huh?
uid01021e10.msg:0019:0x0000122B:0088:5=Don't bother playing coy.
uid01021e10.msg:002a:0x00001245:0094:6=I know you've been meeting with Kondo-san.
uid01021e10.msg:0026:0x00001277:00ac:7=What exactly have you been discussing?
uid01021e10.msg:0034:0x0000129E:00b8:8=I think that question would be better for the chief.
uid01021e10.msg:002a:0x000012D3:00c4:9=He seems to have grown lax in updating me.
uid01021e10.msg:0049:0x000012FE:00d0:10=For example, did you know the Satsuma and Choshu have formed an alliance?
uid01021e10.msg:0023:0x00001348:00dc:11=No clue. None of that's my concern.
uid01021e10.msg:0025:0x0000136C:00e8:12=But Kondo-san ought to know, correct?
uid01021e10.msg:0030:0x00001392:00f4:13=And he would definitely consider it his concern.
uid01021e10.msg:002c:0x000013C3:0100:14=What sets him apart is, he's a true patriot.
uid01021e10.msg:000f:0x000013F0:010c:15=A true patriot?
uid01021e10.msg:0040:0x00001400:0118:16=Someone who's always considering what he can do for the country.
uid01021e10.msg:0043:0x00001441:0124:17=To Kondo-san, a Satcho Alliance is something that must be squashed.
uid01021e10.msg:003a:0x00001485:0130:18=What I don't comprehend is, why he hasn't made a move yet.
uid01021e10.msg:004d:0x000014C7:0148:19=From now on, should you hear anything from Kondo-san, could you report to me?
uid01021e10.msg:0053:0x00001515:0154:20=I'm not the kind of guy who goes around repeating things I heard from other people.
uid01021e10.msg:003e:0x00001569:0160:21=That also means I won't tell Kondo anything you've said to me.
uid01021e10.msg:003a:0x000015AF:0178:22=Talk to the chief yourself if you're so curious about him.
uid01021e10.msg:0051:0x000015EB:0190:23=(The sun's setting... I guess I'll go back to Teradaya and wait until it's time.)
uid01021e16.msg:0008:0x0000153B:004c:1=Okita...
uid01021e16.msg:0064:0x00001544:0058:2=Seems like you 'n the chief've been bendin' each other's ears an awful lot lately, huh, Hajime-chan?
uid01021e16.msg:0005:0x000015A9:0064:3=What?
uid01021e16.msg:0011:0x000015AF:0070:4=Don't act stupid.
uid01021e16.msg:0041:0x000015C1:007c:5=C'mooon, I thought we were buddies! Don't hog <i>all</i> the fun!
uid01021e16.msg:0020:0x0000160A:0094:6=I'm goin' with ya to the castle.
uid01021e16.msg:002d:0x0000162B:00a0:7=Let's bust down them gates an' kick some ass!
uid01021e16.msg:0012:0x00001659:00ac:8=What if I said no?
uid01021e16.msg:003d:0x0000166C:00b8:9=If ya said no... I'd hafta kill ya and go have fun on my own.
uid01021e16.msg:002a:0x000016AA:00c4:10=You know this is basically suicide, right?
uid01021e16.msg:0025:0x000016D5:00d0:11=Where do ya think the fun comes from?
uid01021e16.msg:0060:0x000016FB:00dc:12=An' this ain't even the best part—<i>that</i> comes once we've flushed out that shitbag Ryoma.
uid01021e16.msg:0008:0x0000175C:00e8:13=Right...
uid01021e16.msg:005c:0x00001765:00f4:14=We got a common goal here. I say we take that synergy and roll it right through that castle.
uid01021e16.msg:0041:0x000017C2:0100:15=Ya know the kinda deal yer gettin', landin' my services fer free?
uid01021e16.msg:0009:0x00001804:010c:16=I got it.
uid01021e16.msg:003a:0x0000180E:0118:17=But we leave at dawn. And we ought to lay low before then.
uid01021e16.msg:005b:0x00001849:0124:18=I gotcha—stealth-like. Well, sounds to me like we could be facin' our last hurrah in Kyo.
uid01021e16.msg:0025:0x000018A5:0130:19=How's about we make it a real howler?
uid01021e16.msg:0085:0x000018CB:013c:20=This could be our last chance for some fun... I'm not sure we're going to be able to come back from the place we're about to intrude.
uid01021e16.msg:0043:0x00001951:0148:21=In that case, I'm blowin' through every bit of my pay before we go!
uid01021e16.msg:0055:0x00001995:0154:22=But, in yer case—ain'tcha got someone ya need to give one last, tender farewell...?
uid01021e16.msg:0055:0x000019F2:016c:23=Ya know, she's still really got it goin' on, even if she's gettin' up there in years!
uid01021e16.msg:0019:0x00001A48:0178:24=No, that's the other one.
uid01021e16.msg:0003:0x00001A62:0184:25=Eh?
uid01021e16.msg:000d:0x00001A66:0190:26=It's nothing.
uid01021e16.msg:002c:0x00001A74:019c:27=Welp, until dawn... I'll see ya at Teradaya.
uid01021e16.msg:0038:0x00001AA1:01a8:28=Make sure ya enjoy life while ya still can, Hajime-chan.
uid01021e16.msg:0066:0x00001ADB:01c0:29=(Okita said he'd meet me at Teradaya around dawn... I should make sure I'm ready for Edo before then.)
uid01021e1f.msg:0049:0x0000193E:0070:1=The Shinsengumi Inspector, Yamazaki Susumu, was murdered at the barracks.
uid01021e1f.msg:0005:0x00001988:007c:2=What?
uid01021e1f.msg:0031:0x0000198E:0088:3=Apparently, it was the doing of "Sakamoto Ryoma."
uid01021e1f.msg:0058:0x000019C0:0094:4=I don't think you're in any danger, but... Try not to be out in public too much for now.
uid01021e1f.msg:004d:0x00001A19:00a0:5=You don't have to worry for my sake. Whatever happens, that's not your fault.
uid01021e1f.msg:0020:0x00001A67:00ac:6=No. It <i>would</i> be my fault.
uid01021e1f.msg:003a:0x00001A88:00b8:7=I'm the whole reason you're still wrapped up in this mess.
uid01021e1f.msg:000e:0x00001AC3:00c4:8=But, that's...
uid01021e1f.msg:001a:0x00001AD4:00e8:9=Tomorrow, I leave for Edo.
uid01021e1f.msg:0034:0x00001AEF:00f4:10=And I won't be back until I finish what needs doing.
uid01021e1f.msg:0004:0x00001B24:0100:11=Edo?
uid01021e1f.msg:004f:0x00001B29:010c:12=Are you sure you want to tell me that? Like, what if I betrayed you again, huh?
uid01021e1f.msg:0051:0x00001B7A:0124:13=Once I got out of Tosa, this was the only place where I ever shared my real name.
uid01021e1f.msg:002b:0x00001BCC:0130:14=I don't have anything to hide here anymore.
uid01021e1f.msg:004e:0x00001BF8:013c:15=Besides, depending on how things go in Edo... I may not be coming back at all.
uid01021e1f.msg:0004:0x00001C47:0148:16=Huh?
uid01021e1f.msg:001f:0x00001C4C:0154:17=This is going to be a big deal.
uid01021e1f.msg:0025:0x00001C6C:0160:18=What are you about to do, Hajime-san?
uid01021e1f.msg:005c:0x00001C93:0178:19=I'm planning to speak with the Shogun, face-to-face... and get him to finish off the Bakufu.
uid01021e1f.msg:0009:0x00001CF0:0184:20=No way...
uid01021e1f.msg:003d:0x00001CFA:0190:21=I know it's crazy, but it didn't feel right, not telling you.
uid01021e1f.msg:004d:0x00001D38:019c:22=If I can't make it back to Teradaya, it means I've died with a single regret.
uid01021e1f.msg:000c:0x00001D86:01a8:23=What's that?
uid01021e1f.msg:004f:0x00001D94:01c0:24=I never took the chance... to sit down and really enjoy a meal you made for me.
uid01021e1f.msg:000d:0x00001DE4:01cc:25=Hajime-san...
uid01021e1f.msg:0030:0x00001DF2:01d8:26=I'd like to look forward to that while I'm gone.
uid01021e1f.msg:0029:0x00001E23:01e4:27=Could you do that for me, if I come back?
uid01021e1f.msg:0029:0x00001E4D:01f0:28=I'll feed you 'til you can't leave again.

uid01021e23.msg:002a:0x00000A62:0070:2=Ya get a goodbye quickie in with yer lady?
uid01021e23.msg:0023:0x00000A8D:007c:3=I don't think that's your business.
uid01021e23.msg:004a:0x00000AB1:0088:4=Aw, don't be sore! I just had my own tender goodbyes with someone special.
uid01021e23.msg:0018:0x00000AFC:0094:5=Told me to give ya this.
uid01021e23.msg:0011:0x00000B16:00ac:6=Is this a letter?
uid01021e23.msg:002d:0x00000B28:00b8:7=It's from Kondo-san. For the Tokugawa Shogun.
uid01021e23.msg:002b:0x00000B56:00c4:8=So that's who you were saying goodbye to...
uid01021e23.msg:004f:0x00000B82:00d0:9=Heheh! He said to give this to the Shogun if either of us make it to him alive.
uid01021e27.msg:0084:0x000026F6:0050:1="All ranks of status are henceforth abolished and positions are to be given based on talent, including all court members and lords."
uid01021e27.msg:0026:0x0000277B:005c:2=Sounds like our dream is within sight.
uid01021e27.msg:0017:0x000027A2:0068:3=Ain't that right, Pops?
uid01021e27.msg:0025:0x000027BD:0098:4=Right... Then, how should I put it...
uid01021e27.msg:0065:0x000027E3:00a4:5=This is a series of requests for various ruling parties to change the power structure of the country.
uid01021e27.msg:0016:0x00002849:00b0:6=What kind of requests?
uid01021e27.msg:0069:0x00002860:00bc:7=Well, first is the one I'd mentioned, for the Bakufu to give all ruling power back to the Imperial Court.
uid01021e27.msg:0055:0x000028CA:00c8:8=Next is a list of orders for the Imperial Court to carry out after its reinstatement.
uid01021e27.msg:0016:0x00002920:00d4:9=Tell us what they are.
uid01021e27.msg:0083:0x00002937:00e0:10=So... These don't get into details, but one is to create a congress where national policies can be debated and voted on as a group.
uid01021e27.msg:0086:0x000029BB:00ec:11=Next, there's revisiting the abusive treaties made with foreign powers... Write a constitution for the nation... Reinforce the navy...
uid01021e27.msg:0068:0x00002A42:00f8:12=Establish a city guard for the capital... And set the value of gold and silver to that of other nations.
uid01021e27.msg:002c:0x00002AAB:0104:13=That's the list of requests you're carrying.
uid01021e27.msg:0041:0x00002AD8:0110:14=So, it's basically telling them how to rebuild the whole country?
uid01021e27.msg:0051:0x00002B1A:011c:15=That mean if we add our own shit, the Shogun might actually think about doin' it?
uid01021e27.msg:0051:0x00002B6C:0128:16=Well, no. It'd be the Imperial Court considering it, after getting back in power.
uid01021e27.msg:0025:0x00002BBE:0134:17=I don't care who's givin' the orders!
uid01021e27.msg:002c:0x00002BE4:0140:18=We gotta add somethin' to this while we can!
uid01021e27.msg:0005:0x00002C11:014c:19=What?
uid01021e27.msg:0047:0x00002C17:0158:20=Just think of it as payment for pullin' off this suicide mission, okay?
uid01021e27.msg:0060:0x00002C5F:0164:21=In fact, how 'bout, "Pay Shinsengumi captains enough to live it up for the rest of their lives."
uid01021e27.msg:0016:0x00002CC0:0170:22=Shinsengumi captains!?
uid01021e27.msg:0024:0x00002CD7:017c:23=Hang on, <i>that's</i> who you are!?
uid01021e27.msg:003f:0x00002CFC:0188:24=Yup! So you <i>better</i> do a good job addin' what we tell ya.
uid01021e27.msg:0024:0x00002D3C:0194:25=It'll just be one teensy li'l thing.
uid01021e27.msg:0029:0x00002D61:01a0:26=But, altering someone else's letter is...
uid01021e27.msg:005f:0x00002D8B:01ac:27=Heh, both the Shogun and the Imperial Court would see through us if we told them to pay us out.
uid01021e27.msg:001b:0x00002DEB:01b8:28=I'd have to say so as well.
uid01021e27.msg:0019:0x00002E07:01c4:29=You don't get a say here!
uid01021e27.msg:0064:0x00002E21:01d0:30=Fine then, what would you put in there, Hajime-chan? Not like yer gettin' another chance this sweet.
uid01021e27.msg:003e:0x00002E86:01dc:31=What do I want from the country? I guess I'd ask for equality.
uid01021e27.msg:0004:0x00002EC5:01e8:32=Huh?
uid01021e27.msg:0054:0x00002ECA:01f4:33=Back where I'm from, goshi don't even get treated like humans by the higher classes.
uid01021e27.msg:0027:0x00002F1F:0200:34=It's a horrible way for people to live.
uid01021e27.msg:0017:0x00002F47:020c:35=Yer talkin' about Tosa?
uid01021e27.msg:0030:0x00002F5F:0218:36=Ah, that ain't nuthin' compared to average folk.
uid01021e27.msg:0079:0x00002F90:0224:37=Ya know the chief and the dep' were born peasants? They got all kinds of crazy stories, how they were treated growin' up.
uid01021e27.msg:001f:0x0000300A:0230:38=Yeah—so you know what I mean.
uid01021e27.msg:0052:0x0000302A:023c:39=But now I'm thinkin', is equality really gonna cut it as payment for our delivery?
uid01021e27.msg:0064:0x0000307D:0248:40=Plenty for me. If we pull this off... I'll be able to meet Pops in the afterlife with a proud smile.
uid01021e27.msg:000c:0x000030E2:0254:41=The fuck...?
uid01021e27.msg:0055:0x000030EF:0260:42=Listen, would you be able to add something in there that would grant people equality?
uid01021e27.msg:0027:0x00003145:026c:43=Uh, how would you like me to phrase it?
uid01021e27.msg:0050:0x0000316D:0278:44=So that anyone has a chance to prove their worth, no matter what class they are.
uid01021e27.msg:003d:0x000031BE:0284:45=Not just samurai, either—regular citizens, women, everyone.
uid01021e27.msg:0059:0x000031FC:0290:46=And make it so people can't abuse the rights of others just because they're higher-class.
uid01021e27.msg:0017:0x00003256:029c:47=Wha— Are you serious?
uid01021e27.msg:0012:0x0000326E:02a8:48=Dammit, what now!?
uid01021e27.msg:003f:0x00003281:02b4:49=That... That's exactly the kind of Japan I've always dreamt of!
uid01021e27.msg:005c:0x000032C1:02c0:50=The very same! That's even the reason I went to Kyo—I heard a new age is being born there!
uid01021e27.msg:0035:0x0000331E:02cc:51=But, I... I'm not much with a sword, so, here I am...
uid01021e27.msg:002d:0x00003354:02d8:52=Heh. Well, now your dreams can come true too.
uid01021e27.msg:0034:0x00003382:02e4:53=I have a feeling I can trust you to do this justice.
uid01021e27.msg:001a:0x000033B7:02f0:54=Why, yes! I'd be happy to!
uid01021e2e.msg:001c:0x00001409:0034:1=Huff... Huff... Why, you...!
uid01021e2e.msg:0004:0x0000142E:0058:2=Gah!
uid01021e2e.msg:0058:0x00001433:0064:3=Cutting you down wouldn't kill off the Tokugawa. It'll just keep living with a new head.
uid01021e2e.msg:0051:0x0000148C:0070:4=But, the war the loyalists are trying to start would wipe out your entire family.
uid01021e2e.msg:0030:0x000014DE:007c:5=Huff... You're referring to the Satcho Alliance?
uid01021e2e.msg:001a:0x0000150F:0088:6=You know about it already?
uid01021e2e.msg:004d:0x0000152A:0094:7=Of course. We may be in a weakened state, but we still have spies everywhere.
uid01021e2e.msg:0062:0x00001578:00a0:8=Somebody's been serving as the middleman for the Satcho and a British weapons dealer named Glover.
uid01021e2e.msg:0058:0x000015DB:00ac:9=He trafficks weapons by boat in the hopes of getting the Satcho to take down the Bakufu.
uid01021e2e.msg:005c:0x00001634:00b8:10=Unfortunately, the Satcho might be much more ready for war than you may have heard, my lord.
uid01021e2e.msg:0037:0x00001691:00c4:11=They could very well launch their attack at any minute.
uid01021e2e.msg:004e:0x000016C9:00d0:12=What small-minded fools. This is no time for Japan to suffer from in-fighting.
uid01021e2e.msg:002c:0x00001718:00dc:13=So, are you a representative for the Satcho?
uid01021e2e.msg:0056:0x00001745:00e8:14=I'm... just a delivery man, here with the one thing that could prevent full-scale war.
uid01021e2e.msg:001c:0x0000179C:00f4:15=What could prevent this war?
uid01021e2e.msg:000b:0x000017BA:010c:16=This is...?
uid01021e2e.msg:0008:0x000017C7:0124:17=My Lord!
uid01021e2e.msg:0033:0x000017D0:0130:18=You mustn't allow these ruffians to have their way!
uid01021e2e.msg:0049:0x00001804:013c:19=I imagine I'll be killed if I don't hear him out. You as well, of course.
uid01021e2e.msg:000e:0x0000184E:0148:20=Oh... Oh no...
uid01021e2e.msg:002c:0x00001860:0178:21=Hey, nice work! I'm good to go, Hajime-chan.
uid01021e2e.msg:0019:0x0000188D:0184:22=I'm nearly done here too.
uid01021e35.msg:002c:0x00000661:0044:1=What, you got a lady? She here or something?
uid01021e35.msg:0037:0x0000068E:0050:2=No, but she left a letter. Looks like she fled already.
uid01021e35.msg:002c:0x000006C6:005c:3=Well, safe to say you're relieved, then, eh?
uid01021e35.msg:0032:0x000006F3:0068:4=...Right, guess there's only one thing left to do.
uid01021e35.msg:001a:0x00000726:0074:5=Yeah. We gotta find Kondo.
uid01021e35.msg:0071:0x00000741:0080:6=(Of all the places Kondo would be... My guess is either that ryotei in Gion or over at the Shinsengumi barracks.)
uid01021e35.msg:003f:0x000007B4:0098:7=(I'm worried about Oryo and Otose! I should hurry to Teradaya!)
uid01021e3a.msg:0064:0x000014C7:005c:1=Oh, still comin'. Y'know, if ya got all this time, maybe y'oughta put out the fires yourselves, eh!?
uid01021e3a.msg:0018:0x0000152C:0068:2=You're not getting away!
uid01021e3a.msg:001d:0x00001545:0074:3=Damn, there's no end to them.
uid01021e3a.msg:0050:0x00001563:0080:4=What can ya do? I got it from here, so you go find Isami. Got that, Hajime-chan?
uid01021e3a.msg:001f:0x000015B4:008c:5=All right. I'm counting on you.
uid01021e3a.msg:0025:0x000015D4:0098:6=Heheh. Like I'd lose to these chumps.
uid01021e3a.msg:0030:0x000015FA:00a4:7=All right, boys! Let's have a little fun, yeah!?
uid01021e3a.msg:0020:0x00001630:00ec:8=Where do you think you're goin'?
uid01021e3a.msg:004f:0x00001651:00f8:9=Tch... If it ain't Sasaki-han. What business do the Kyo Mimawarigurmi got here?
uid01021e3a.msg:0059:0x000016A1:0104:10=What business? Should be obvious. We know the Shinsengumi are the ones causin' this mess.
uid01021e3a.msg:0042:0x00001702:011c:11=I don't know what you're plannin', but I'll see you answer for it!
uid01021e3a.msg:0042:0x00001746:0134:12=Can't even hear us out. Ah well, I was wantin' to let loose a bit.
uid01021e3a.msg:000a:0x00001789:0140:13=Dammit...!
uid01021e3a.msg:0008:0x00001794:014c:14=Get 'em!
uid01021e41.msg:0043:0x00001BCC:0028:1=(Are those guys from the Tenth Division? What are they doing here?)
uid01021e41.msg:0041:0x00001C11:0040:2=Captain, we've swiped everything of value from these houses here.
uid01021e41.msg:0050:0x00001C53:004c:3=Right on. Then, it looks like we're done. All right, boys! Time to light 'em up!
uid01021e41.msg:0005:0x00001CA5:0064:4=Stop!
uid01021e41.msg:001b:0x00001CAC:007c:5=...Hm? Oh, it's you, Saito.
uid01021e41.msg:001b:0x00001CC8:0088:6=Harada, what are you doing?
uid01021e41.msg:006c:0x00001CE4:0094:7="Burn it all down." That's the order we got from Chief Kondo. Every captain shoulda got the message already.
uid01021e41.msg:0010:0x00001D51:00a0:8=So it is true...
uid01021e41.msg:003e:0x00001D62:00ac:9=Heh, about damn time the Shinsengumi took over, if you ask me!
uid01021e41.msg:0047:0x00001DA1:00b8:10=And that means looting and burning people's homes? How low can you get?
uid01021e41.msg:0054:0x00001DE9:00c4:11=What? It's all going to shit anyway. No sense letting <i>everything</i> turn to ash.
uid01021e41.msg:0075:0x00001E45:00dc:12=What's it to you? Mibu Wolf trying to play the hero all of a sudden? If you got something to say, then step right up.
uid01021e41.msg:002d:0x00001EBC:00f4:13=Heh, I figured I'd take you on at some point.
uid01021e41.msg:0048:0x00001EEA:0100:14=And with everyone running for the hills, I'd say now's the perfect time.
uid01021e41.msg:0011:0x00001F33:010c:15=What do you mean?
uid01021e41.msg:006e:0x00001F45:0118:16=I mean I can keep wailing on a glory-sucking tenderfoot like you, and the other captains'll be none the wiser.
uid01021e41.msg:0019:0x00001FB4:0124:17=You're not using a sword?
uid01021e41.msg:0065:0x00001FCE:0130:18=Huh? You see the reach on this thing? Using a sword'd be like trying to fight with a pair of sandals.
uid01021e41.msg:0037:0x00002034:013c:19=Guess you've never seen what a real sword can do, then.
uid01021e41.msg:0074:0x0000206C:0148:20=Heh, guess so. If I remember right, you joined the Shinsengumi 'cause you were chasing after the Rishin style, yeah?
uid01021e41.msg:002b:0x000020E1:0154:21=Then, I'll let you in on a little secret...
uid01021e41.msg:000c:0x0000210D:0160:22=What's that?
uid01021e41.msg:005f:0x0000211A:016c:23=The strongest out of the Shieikan bunch isn't Okita, or Nagakura, or even the Chief... It's me.
uid01021e41.msg:001b:0x0000217A:0178:24=And what makes you so sure?
uid01021e41.msg:0007:0x00002196:0184:25=Easy...
uid01021e41.msg:005b:0x0000219F:019c:26=You see, I do whatever I gotta do to win. To hell with all that crap about pride and style.
uid01021e41.msg:0006:0x000021FB:01a8:27=I see.
uid01021e41.msg:0050:0x00002203:01c0:28=Looks like you need to be taught a lesson. I'll show you just why I use a sword.
uid01021e41.msg:0029:0x00002254:01cc:29=Hah... Oh please, by all means, teach me.
uid01021e41.msg:0017:0x0000227F:01e4:30=Hmph. Here goes, Saito!
uid01021e48.msg:0027:0x00000100:0028:1=(This way should get me to the palace.)
uid01021e49.msg:0030:0x00001A48:0058:1=Do you plan to leave the Shinsengumi, Saito-kun?
uid01021e49.msg:000b:0x00001A7A:0070:2=Hijikata...
uid01021e49.msg:0040:0x00001A86:007c:3=I heard from Soji... Why you came here, your true name, and all.
uid01021e49.msg:000e:0x00001AC8:0094:4=Is that right?
uid01021e49.msg:001d:0x00001AD8:00ac:5=You runnin' off, Hajime-chan?
uid01021e49.msg:000c:0x00001AF7:00c4:6=Running off?
uid01021e49.msg:004a:0x00001B05:00dc:7=You heard me... Ya got no reason to stay in the Shinsengumi anymore, sure.
uid01021e49.msg:0068:0x00001B50:00e8:8=But leavin' your allies behind and thinkin' ya can solve things yourself? Sounds like runnin' off to me.
uid01021e49.msg:005e:0x00001BB9:00f4:9=Bein' a lone wolf sounds a lot cooler, I'll give ya that... But it ain't gonna do ya any good.
uid01021e49.msg:0034:0x00001C18:0100:10=If you're bringin' the fight, ya gotta bring backup.
uid01021e49.msg:000f:0x00001C4E:0118:11=And why's that?
uid01021e49.msg:0054:0x00001C5E:0124:12=When a man's got somethin' important to do, he's gotta have someone keep an eye out.
uid01021e49.msg:0076:0x00001CB4:013c:13=Someone to fight, think, laugh, and cry with... Sharin' the moment means sharin' the truth. That's how history's made.
uid01021e49.msg:0052:0x00001D2B:0148:14=It's why Chief Kondo, even at his last breath, never tossed the Shinsengumi aside.
uid01021e49.msg:0077:0x00001D7E:0154:15=Well, I've caused the Shinsengumi enough trouble as it is... From now on, this is Sakamoto Ryoma's fight and his alone.
uid01021e49.msg:006a:0x00001DF6:0160:16=Don't gimme that. So what if it's one man's fight? The Shinsengumi got more than enough reason to join in.
uid01021e49.msg:0008:0x00001E61:016c:17=Okita...
uid01021e49.msg:001c:0x00001E6A:0178:18=Ain't that right, Shinpachi?
uid01021e49.msg:0039:0x00001E87:0184:19=Yeah. It's what livin' alongside the Chief was all about.
uid01021e49.msg:000b:0x00001EC2:019c:20=Nagakura...
uid01021e49.msg:000b:0x00001ED0:01c0:21=Hijikata...
uid01021e49.msg:0053:0x00001EDD:01d8:22=What's more, Sakamoto-san, Saito Hajime still has some unfinished business with us.
uid01021e49.msg:0036:0x00001F31:01e4:23=Business? Kondo told me his final move was in there...
uid01021e49.msg:0033:0x00001F68:01f0:24=So Kondo Isami lives on, even after death, hm? Hah.
uid01021e4f.msg:0040:0x00001F3D:0064:1=Sorry to make you all wait. Last night really took it out of me.
uid01021e4f.msg:004f:0x00001F80:0088:2=To think that Chief Kondo would have the novel idea of burning the city down...
uid01021e4f.msg:0074:0x00001FD0:0094:3=Gotta say, though, setting fire to folks and watching them scurry doesn't exactly make you feel warm inside. Hahaha.
uid01021e4f.msg:002a:0x00002045:00a0:4=You're certainly talkative today, Ito-kun.
uid01021e4f.msg:0033:0x00002070:00ac:5=Ah, forgive me... So, what's today's meeting about?
uid01021e4f.msg:004c:0x000020A4:00b8:6=I thought now would be a good time to discuss the future of the Shinsengumi.
uid01021e4f.msg:007b:0x000020F3:00dc:7=In light of what happened, the magistrate's office came to investigate. They seem to think the Shinsengumi was responsible.
uid01021e4f.msg:001a:0x0000216F:00e8:8=Well, of course they do...
uid01021e4f.msg:006b:0x0000218A:00f4:9=Nevertheless, we were able to settle it by telling them Tenth Division Captain Harada Sanosuke acted alone.
uid01021e4f.msg:0043:0x000021F6:0100:10=Heh, diverting all the attention to a dead man, huh? Good thinking.
uid01021e4f.msg:0070:0x0000223A:010c:11=Actually, we didn't divert anything. Soji, Nagakura, Saito-kun, and I had nothing to do with last night's arson.
uid01021e4f.msg:008f:0x000022AB:0118:12=The ones responsible were our advisor, Ito-san, and Harada's Tenth Divison. In addition, of course, to you and your Fifth Division, Takeda-san.
uid01021e4f.msg:0008:0x0000233B:0124:13=Wha—!?
uid01021e4f.msg:0052:0x0000234B:013c:14=We were well aware that the order to burn the city was not from Kondo-san himself.
uid01021e4f.msg:0050:0x0000239E:0148:15=You may not have known, but Kondo-san did indeed have a plan to set fire to Kyo.
uid01021e4f.msg:0059:0x000023EF:0154:16=Despite this, there was no signal to execute said plan. Thus, we had no part in the fire.
uid01021e4f.msg:0007:0x00002449:0160:17=Signal?
uid01021e4f.msg:005a:0x00002451:016c:18=That's right, the disbandment of the Shinsengumi... That's the signal that we'd agreed on.
uid01021e4f.msg:0006:0x000024AC:0178:19=What!?
uid01021e4f.msg:0049:0x000024BB:019c:20=Kondo-san had been planning to move the capital to Edo for several years.
uid01021e4f.msg:0066:0x00002505:01a8:21=But in reality, only a select few members of the Shinsengumi, those he trusted, were informed of this.
uid01021e4f.msg:0086:0x0000256C:01b4:22=That's why I say the fire couldn't have been ordered by the Chief. Knowing that wasn't the case, we quickly took action to put it out.
uid01021e4f.msg:0019:0x000025F3:01c0:23=I see. I never knew that.
uid01021e4f.msg:0067:0x0000260D:01cc:24=I won't hold it against you. You all thought it was an order from the top, and you followed it loyally.
uid01021e4f.msg:0065:0x00002675:01d8:25=Although, one might say it was impulsive on your part. Hardly what one might expect of their advisor.
uid01021e4f.msg:0033:0x000026DC:01f0:26=...Well, whatever. So what's this about the future?
uid01021e58.msg:0019:0x00001155:0034:1=Yeah, I'm ready whenever.
uid01021e58.msg:0040:0x0000116F:0040:2=My life in this city as Saito Hajime was a lie from the start...
uid01021e58.msg:001d:0x000011B0:004c:3=Leaving it won't be too hard.
uid01021e58.msg:001e:0x000011CE:0058:4=And Oryo-chan? What about her?
uid01021e58.msg:004b:0x000011ED:0064:5=What about her? She doesn't need to be tied down to Kyo any more than I do.
uid01021e58.msg:003c:0x00001239:0070:6=She has the right to go wherever and live however she wants.
uid01021e58.msg:003b:0x00001276:007c:7=Sure... But ain't that what she was doin' over at Teradaya?
uid01021e58.msg:0082:0x000012B2:0088:8=Even after all that noise about her bein' a spy came out, she stayed put and just kept on waitin' for ya. That's something, right?
uid01021e58.msg:000e:0x00001335:0094:9=Hard to say...
uid01021e58.msg:0021:0x00001344:00a0:10=Y'know, Oryo-chan's just like us.
uid01021e58.msg:0055:0x00001366:00ac:11=She got forced to live a separate life, one where she couldn't even be her real self.
uid01021e58.msg:007e:0x000013BC:00b8:12=I been thinkin' about it, livin' a fake life like that. And, really, it's <i>all</i> part of who you are, even the fake stuff.
uid01021e58.msg:0077:0x0000143B:00c4:13=That's why I say those days she spent fallin' for Saito Hajime and chasin' after you 'n shit were as real as it gets...
uid01021e58.msg:0037:0x000014BA:00dc:14=Hajime-chan, your life as Saito Hajime was never a lie.
uid01021e58.msg:006a:0x000014F2:00e8:15=He definitely lived in this time, in this moment, as the captain of the Third Division. Right here in Kyo.
uid01021e58.msg:0030:0x0000155D:00f4:16=Ya know damn well you can't throw all that away.
uid01021e58.msg:0070:0x00001595:010c:17=Y'oughta give a proper farewell to Oryo-chan... We're not shippin' off till tomorrow morning. Ya still got time.
uid01021e58.msg:0026:0x00001608:0130:18=Yeah... you're right. Thanks, brother.
uid01021e58.msg:001f:0x0000162F:013c:19="Brother"? What's up with that?
uid01021e58.msg:0045:0x0000164F:0148:20=You've always had my back... I just mean you're like a sibling to me.
uid01021e58.msg:0061:0x00001695:0154:21=Well, ain't that the darndest thing? Ah well. Anyway, go on and take care of business, all right?
uid01021e5d.msg:003c:0x00002675:0044:1=Oho, I'd expected as much from the Mibu Wolves' best, but...
uid01021e5d.msg:0006:0x000026B4:0068:2=Tch...
uid01021e5d.msg:001f:0x000026BB:0074:3=Quite the squad you have there.
uid01021e5d.msg:002d:0x000026DC:008c:4=I'll take it from here. You guys go on ahead.
uid01021e5d.msg:000c:0x0000270A:0098:5=Shinpachi...
uid01021e5d.msg:0038:0x00002717:00a4:6=Gimme a break, Shinpa-chan. Ya tryin' to steal the show?
uid01021e5d.msg:0053:0x00002750:00b0:7=This ain't the time to be jokin' around. Soji, Hijikata-han. You two protect Saito.
uid01021e5d.msg:0007:0x000027A5:00c8:8=Got it?
uid01021e5d.msg:003c:0x000027AD:00d4:9=Heh. Stubborn as a mule. All right, fine. They're all yours.
uid01021e5d.msg:0036:0x000027EA:00e0:10=Just don't let the Mimawarigumi get the better of you.
uid01021e5d.msg:000b:0x00002821:00ec:11=Nagakura...
uid01021e5d.msg:0047:0x0000282E:0104:12=Saito, you got a special role in all this. I'm gonna be countin' on ya.
uid01021e5d.msg:0010:0x00002877:011c:13=Right. Let's go!
uid01021e5d.msg:001a:0x00002888:0128:14=Don't die on me, Nagakura.
uid01021e5d.msg:0019:0x000028AA:0188:15=So ya finally showed, eh?
uid01021e5d.msg:0014:0x000028C5:01a0:16=Sasaki Tadasaburo...
uid01021e5d.msg:0031:0x000028DB:01b8:17=Why're the Kyo Mimawarigumi workin' with Takechi?
uid01021e5d.msg:0037:0x0000290D:01c4:18=You hatamoto wouldn't be nothin' if not for the Bakufu.
uid01021e5d.msg:003a:0x00002946:01dc:19=Heh. Don't lump me in with those sniveling little lapdogs.
uid01021e5d.msg:0035:0x00002982:01f4:20=I don't give a damn whether the Bakufu stays or goes.
uid01021e5d.msg:0078:0x000029B8:0200:21=We haven't seen the country this torn up since the Sengoku period... No way in hell I'm lettin' someone spoil the party.
uid01021e5d.msg:0008:0x00002A31:020c:22=What...?
uid01021e5d.msg:0058:0x00002A3A:0218:23=I can't tell you how many times I cursed the hand I got, how friggin' boring it all was.
uid01021e5d.msg:005f:0x00002A93:0224:24=But it looks like the gods didn't forsake me after all. These wild times are a gift, I tell ya.
uid01021e5d.msg:0034:0x00002AF3:0230:25=You mean you sided with Takechi just to start a war.
uid01021e5d.msg:005c:0x00002B28:023c:26=Heheh. Thought you were just some head-up-his-ass rich boy, but we might actually get along.
uid01021e5d.msg:0022:0x00002B8C:0254:27=Now, how 'bout we stop jawin', eh?
uid01021e5d.msg:003d:0x00002BAF:0260:28=I got the Shinsengumi's top boys here... Don't disappoint me.
uid01021e5d.msg:000d:0x00002BED:026c:29=Let's rumble!
uid01021e68.msg:0038:0x00001E4D:0044:1=Impressive... As I thought, you're all on another level.
uid01021e68.msg:003b:0x00001E86:0050:2=We wouldn't want you to underestimate the Shinsengumi, Ito.
uid01021e68.msg:0010:0x00001EC2:005c:3=Maybe so, but...
uid01021e68.msg:0009:0x00001ED4:0074:4=But what?
uid01021e68.msg:0035:0x00001EDE:0080:5=Didn't I tell you? I've stepped it up these days too.
uid01021e68.msg:0023:0x00001F15:0098:6=Saito-kun, I'll handle things here.
uid01021e68.msg:000f:0x00001F39:00a4:7=Hijikata-san...
uid01021e68.msg:003a:0x00001F49:00b0:8=The castle is close by. We can't afford to be stopped now.
uid01021e68.msg:0057:0x00001F8B:00c8:9=Takechi is your opponent and yours only. If you understand, then you better get moving!
uid01021e68.msg:001a:0x00001FE3:00d4:10=Hijikata-san... Thank you.
uid01021e68.msg:001a:0x00002000:00f8:11=It's up to you, Saito-kun!
uid01021e68.msg:004b:0x0000201D:011c:12=Oh, well, well. Hijikata-san, Okita-kun... and even Saito-kun's come along.
uid01021e68.msg:0008:0x00002069:0128:13=Ito...!?
uid01021e68.msg:002c:0x00002072:0134:14=You missed a real opportunity, Hijikata-san.
uid01021e68.msg:005c:0x0000209F:0140:15=If you'd just made me Chief back then, the Shinsengumi would be bigger and better than ever.
uid01021e68.msg:0034:0x00002103:0158:16=Just think, you could never achieve power like this.
uid01021e68.msg:0030:0x00002139:0170:17=Oh, that's right. I've been meaning to show you.
uid01021e68.msg:0031:0x0000216B:0188:18=The culmination of all my efforts, the Goryo Eji.
uid01021e68.msg:000a:0x0000219D:0194:19=Bastard...
uid01021e68.msg:0076:0x000021A8:01a0:20=I've put them through some special training. Thanks to me, they're leagues ahead of what they were in the Shinsengumi.
uid01021e68.msg:001e:0x0000221F:01ac:21=Anyhow, let's begin, shall we?
uid01021e68.msg:0013:0x0000223F:01c4:22=Now! Kill them all!
uid01021e6d.msg:000d:0x00002F09:0044:1=Impossible...
uid01021e6d.msg:0047:0x00002F18:005c:2=That all you got? I was just startin' to have fun, Thomas Glamour-chan.
uid01021e6d.msg:002a:0x00002F60:0068:3=You'll regret those words...! How's this!?
uid01021e6d.msg:000d:0x00002F8E:0098:4=What the...!?
uid01021e6d.msg:006f:0x00002F9C:00a4:5=Heheheh... To think I'd pull out all the stops for a couple of pests... Nevertheless, it's time we finish this!
uid01021e6d.msg:0006:0x0000300C:00b0:6=Tch...
uid01021e6d.msg:002a:0x00003013:00bc:7=Heheh, that's more like it. I'm all yours.
uid01021e6d.msg:0008:0x0000303E:00c8:8=Okita...
uid01021e6d.msg:0072:0x00003047:00d4:9=Hajime-chan, it looks like I won't get my stab at Takechi. Breakin' this little toy here should be a riot, though.
uid01021e6d.msg:005a:0x000030BA:00e0:10=Do you really think you can take on a cannon, much less all of these troops, on your own!?
uid01021e6d.msg:0034:0x00003115:00ec:11=Go on, beat it. You got a score to settle, don'tcha?
uid01021e6d.msg:000a:0x00003152:0110:12=Brother...
uid01021e6d.msg:0047:0x0000315E:0128:13=...Yeah, that's still embarrassin' as hell. Get a move on, Hajime-chan!
uid01021e6d.msg:000a:0x000031A6:0134:14=Thank you!
uid01021e6d.msg:003f:0x000031B3:0158:15=All right, who's first? My Kiku Ichimonji's thirstin' for more!
uid01021e6d.msg:0007:0x000031F5:017c:16=Grr...!
uid01021e6d.msg:0021:0x00003202:01c4:17=That's quite enough, Mibu Wolves.
uid01021e6d.msg:000c:0x00003225:01dc:18=Who are you?
uid01021e6d.msg:0069:0x00003232:01e8:19=Allow me to introduce myself. I'm what you would call an international trader—Thomas Glover's the name.
uid01021e6d.msg:0066:0x0000329C:01f4:20=Thomas Glover? Then, you're the arms dealer that allied with Takechi and gave weapons to the Satcho...
uid01021e6d.msg:0079:0x00003303:0200:21=Ah, so you were aware. Yes, Takechi-sensei has been quite the patron. Or perhaps I should call him Sakamoto Ryoma-sensei?
uid01021e6d.msg:007b:0x00003384:0218:22=Now, as to the reason I'm here. You see, in order for Takechi-sensei's efforts to flourish, I figured I'd best lend a hand.
uid01021e6d.msg:0062:0x00003406:0260:23=That is to say your little game's come to an end. And at the hands of Western innovation, no less.
uid01021e6d.msg:0054:0x00003469:026c:24=It almost seems a waste to go at it with you savages and your archaic cutlery there.
uid01021e6d.msg:000e:0x000034BE:0278:25=That right...?
uid01021e6d.msg:0022:0x000034CE:0290:26=I take it you're ready? Open fire!
uid01021e72.msg:0009:0x000003D3:004c:1=Sakamoto!
uid01021e72.msg:000a:0x000003DD:0058:2=Nakaoka...
uid01021e76.msg:0023:0x000017C8:0038:1=(Right now, I just want a drink...)
uid01021e76.msg:004a:0x000017EC:0044:2=(I'll try Fukufuku—it's somewhere in Ichibangai, if I remember right...)
uid01021e76.msg:0012:0x00001839:0068:3=So, Takechi was...
uid01021e76.msg:003c:0x0000184C:0074:4=Yeah... Sentenced to seppuku by Yamauchi Yodo, Lord of Tosa.
uid01021e76.msg:0055:0x00001889:0080:5=They knew he had masterminded the deaths of Bakufu leaders in Kyo, through Okada Izo.
uid01021e76.msg:0006:0x000018DF:008c:6=*sigh*
uid01021e76.msg:0042:0x000018E6:0098:7=Apparently, Izo confessed to everything after being taken to Tosa.
uid01021e76.msg:0055:0x00001929:00a4:8=Said Takechi Hanpeita was the one who gave him the orders for all the murders in Kyo.
uid01021e76.msg:001c:0x00001980:00bc:9=What— Where are you going?
uid01021e76.msg:0031:0x000019A4:00d4:10=Don't tell me you're planning to go back to Tosa.
uid01021e76.msg:005c:0x000019DD:00ec:11=You're guilty of dappan. If you set one foot in Tosa, you're gonna end up just like Takechi.
uid01021e76.msg:0014:0x00001A3A:00f8:12=I know that, but...!
uid01021e76.msg:0088:0x00001A4F:0104:13=Just calm down for now. This thing with Takechi—I have a feeling the mastermind behind Toyo-sama's assassination is on the move again.
uid01021e76.msg:0005:0x00001AD8:0110:14=What?
uid01021e76.msg:0046:0x00001ADE:011c:15=Lord Yodo's been awfully quick with this whole thing, don't you think?
uid01021e76.msg:007d:0x00001B25:0128:16=From the moment Izo was captured, Takechi was their next target. That makes me think someone's been whispering in Yodo's ear.
uid01021e76.msg:0027:0x00001BA3:0134:17=You mean... That's who had Pops killed?
uid01021e76.msg:005a:0x00001BCB:0140:18=Whoever it was, there's little doubt that they wanted to wipe Toyo's faction out for good.
uid01021e76.msg:0046:0x00001C26:014c:19=And, if my read of the situation is right... their next target is you.
uid01021e76.msg:005e:0x00001C6D:0158:20=That would mean, whoever this is would love nothing more than finding out you're back in Tosa.
uid01021e76.msg:0098:0x00001CD3:0170:21=Consider the alternative: if you were to find the masked man here in Kyo, I think that'd strike a bigger blow to him than anything you could do in Tosa.
uid01021e76.msg:006a:0x00001D6C:017c:22=So, that's what you're trying to get at? The only thing I can do is go out there and hunt around the city?
uid01021e76.msg:002c:0x00001DD7:0188:23=I was actually hoping you'd calm down first.
uid01021e76.msg:000a:0x00001E04:0194:24=Damn it...
uid01021e76.msg:0054:0x00001E0F:01a0:25=Sakamoto, I'll go to Tosa for you—poke around Takechi's death and see what I find.
uid01021e76.msg:0009:0x00001E64:01ac:26=You will?
uid01021e76.msg:0080:0x00001E6E:01b8:27=I couldn't live with myself if I just walked away from this mess. Toyo-sama, and Takechi... I need to know who wanted them dead.
uid01021e76.msg:0042:0x00001EEF:01c4:28=Until I find out the truth, I know I won't be able to let this go.
uid01021e76.msg:0031:0x00001F32:01d0:29=It's time for us to forge our own way to move on.
uid01021e76.msg:0054:0x00001F64:01dc:30=Both you and I were born in Tosa, betrayed by Tosa... and now we're haunted by Tosa.
uid01021e76.msg:0066:0x00001FB9:01e8:31=Yeah... That being said, you just stick around town. I know Takechi's death has really affected you...
uid01021e76.msg:0063:0x00002020:01f4:32=But we'll only get what we want if you lay low. Don't even show face at Shinsengumi HQ for a while.
uid01021e76.msg:0036:0x00002084:0200:33=Fine... Just fill me in as soon as you learn anything.
uid01021e7c.msg:0033:0x00000BE8:0038:1=(That woman... It's like she saw right through me.)
uid01021e7c.msg:004c:0x00000C1C:0044:2=(Well, if I can get drunk there, I'm in. Matsunoi, in Kuramachi, I think...)
uid01021e7c.msg:0024:0x00000C6D:0080:3=You sure are drinking a lot, mister.
uid01021e7c.msg:0062:0x00000C9A:00a4:4=Can't say you look like you're enjoying it, though. Maybe it even feels like a waste of sake here?
uid01021e7c.msg:0042:0x00000D04:00bc:5=How about someplace a little quieter, does that sound good to you?
uid01021e7c.msg:001f:0x00000D47:00c8:6=If so, I happen to know a spot.
uid01021e7c.msg:004c:0x00000D6E:00e0:7=It's over in Kuramachi—a place called Matsunoi. I'll be waiting for you...
uid01021e7c.msg:0012:0x00000DBC:00f8:8=Wait. Who are you?
uid01021e7c.msg:0033:0x00000DCF:0104:9=I'll only tell you once I see you there. Till then.
uid01021e83.msg:0018:0x00002050:0068:1=Ah, you already started.
uid01021e83.msg:001b:0x0000206C:0098:2=It's you... Katsura Kogoro.
uid01021e83.msg:0060:0x00002088:00a4:3=It's been a while. I still owe you big for the other day. Hoped I'd get the chance to thank you.
uid01021e83.msg:0052:0x000020E9:00b0:4=You mean Ikedaya? I was only paying you back for introducing me to the Bathkeeper.
uid01021e83.msg:001d:0x0000213C:00bc:5=Way I see it, now we're even.
uid01021e83.msg:0061:0x0000215A:00c8:6=Oh, I'd forgotten about that. Damn... Well, I suppose you owin' me another favor isn't the worst.
uid01021e83.msg:0024:0x000021BC:00d4:7=Forget that stuff. Why are you here?
uid01021e83.msg:0027:0x000021E1:00e0:8=Ah... Matter of fact, this is my place.
uid01021e83.msg:000f:0x00002209:00ec:9=Then, you're...
uid01021e83.msg:004f:0x00002219:00f8:10=Allow me to introduce myself. I am Ikumatsu. Pleasure making your acquaintance.
uid01021e83.msg:0055:0x00002269:0104:11=I really do wanna show you how grateful I am, though. That's why I had you come here.
uid01021e83.msg:001f:0x000022C0:011c:12=I heard about Takechi Hanpeita.
uid01021e83.msg:0008:0x000022E1:0134:13=Oh yeah?
uid01021e83.msg:0030:0x000022EA:0140:14=I didn't have the time to tell you at Ikedaya...
uid01021e83.msg:0061:0x0000231B:014c:15=But Takechi-san asked me to look out for you, in case anything ever, you know... happened to him.
uid01021e83.msg:000f:0x0000237D:0158:16=My brother did?
uid01021e83.msg:0033:0x0000238D:0164:17=Yes. It was right after you joined the Shinsengumi.
uid01021e83.msg:006e:0x000023C1:0170:18=Takechi-san was trying to find a way to get you back to Tosa for so long, but then you joined the Shinsengumi.
uid01021e83.msg:0085:0x00002430:017c:19=The same group after Takechi-san's life... He wanted to be closer to you, but he just couldn't risk it. I imagine it was hard on him.
uid01021e83.msg:005f:0x000024BD:0194:20=Takechi-san knew I'd been looking for a capable swordsman. That must be why he had me find you.
uid01021e83.msg:0083:0x0000251D:01a0:21=The amount of groveling he gave the other loyalist leaders, for your sake... He always cared about you, even after you parted ways.
uid01021e83.msg:002b:0x000025A8:01b8:22=Saito-san... What do you plan on doing now?
uid01021e83.msg:000a:0x000025D4:01c4:23=Who knows?
uid01021e83.msg:0034:0x000025DF:01d0:24=<i>I</i> know the reason you joined the Shinsengumi.
uid01021e83.msg:0057:0x00002614:01dc:25=That's in the past, though. I know I already asked you, but why don't you come join me?
uid01021e83.msg:000b:0x0000266C:01e8:26=And Choshu?
uid01021e83.msg:0050:0x00002678:01f4:27=Takechi-san left us with an awfully long list of things that still need doing...
uid01021e83.msg:0073:0x000026C9:0200:28=And I think you're the best person to inherit that list. Won't you join me in changing this country for the better?
uid01021e83.msg:0016:0x0000273D:020c:29=Thanks for the drinks.
uid01021e83.msg:000a:0x00002754:0218:30=Ryoma-san?
uid01021e83.msg:0030:0x0000275F:0224:31=Sorry... I just don't care about that right now.
uid01021e83.msg:0018:0x00002793:0254:32=Welcome. Please come in.

uid01021e88.msg:003b:0x00000FF1:00ac:10=I won the fight. I choose the punishment. You can't refuse.
uid01021e88.msg:001a:0x0000102D:00b8:11=Ohhh. Sure... Let's drink.
uid01021e88.msg:0029:0x00001048:00c4:12=Even packs a punch when he's wasted, huh?

uid01021e8e.msg:0035:0x000009BE:004c:3=However much it'll take to drink you under the table.
uid01021e8e.msg:0032:0x000009F4:0058:4=Saito-san, you really want to make this a contest?
uid01021e8e.msg:004d:0x00000A27:0064:5=Hmph, yer on. Now I'm definitely gettin' back atcha for those first two wins.
uid01021e8e.msg:002d:0x00000A75:0070:6=Oh, for the love of— Fine, count me in too.

uid01021e8e.msg:0030:0x00000B08:00c4:9=I can't believe we really drank all their booze.
uid01021e8e.msg:0047:0x00000B39:00d0:10=In that case, maybe we oughta call it a night. Excuse me? Check please.
uid01021e97.msg:0020:0x00000744:0028:1=Sorry you had to cover the bill.
uid01021e97.msg:0030:0x00000765:0034:2=Haha, it's fine. Nothing I can't handle, anyway.
uid01021e97.msg:005d:0x00000796:0040:3=I'm gonna mind m'self and head home, but the next time I see ya... Get ready fer round three.

uid01021e97.msg:001e:0x0000081B:0058:5=Hey. You're not done here yet.
uid01021e97.msg:0010:0x0000083A:0064:6=Huh? Whadja say?

uid01021e97.msg:0043:0x0000088B:00b8:9=(It's not really my scene, but it might take my mind off things...)
uid01021e9a.msg:000f:0x00001A18:0028:1=Hey! More sake!
uid01021e9a.msg:0020:0x00001A28:0034:2=You're <i>still</i> drinkin'...?
uid01021e9a.msg:002f:0x00001A49:0040:3=Ugh... What am I even doing here with this guy?
uid01021e9a.msg:006b:0x00001A79:004c:4=Drop it. We've been having a good time together, and you two can't stop from goin' at each other's throats.
uid01021e9a.msg:006b:0x00001AE5:0058:5=Of course! Saito-san, do you have any idea how much suffering Satsuma's put Choshu through, over the years?
uid01021e9a.msg:0050:0x00001B51:0064:6=Heh! Petty li'l wimp. If yer what Choshu calls a leader, I ain't scared of shit.
uid01021e9a.msg:0014:0x00001BA2:0070:7=The hell you say...?
uid01021e9a.msg:001c:0x00001BB7:007c:8=You guys still don't get it.
uid01021e9a.msg:003f:0x00001BD4:0088:9=What's it gonna take to make you stop killing and just move on?
uid01021e9a.msg:0037:0x00001C14:0094:10=What reward are you really getting from all this death?
uid01021e9a.msg:0070:0x00001C53:00ac:11="Just move on," eh? Pretty choice words, coming from you. You ever plan to just let bygones be bygones yourself?
uid01021e9a.msg:0057:0x00001CC5:00c4:12=He said almost the exact same thing to me. That I should inherit Pops's will instead...
uid01021e9a.msg:0004:0x00001D1D:00d0:13=Hmm?
uid01021e9a.msg:0063:0x00001D22:00dc:14=And I knew he was right. It was just like he said. But I'm just not built the same way Brother was.
uid01021e9a.msg:0047:0x00001D86:00e8:15=I just don't know how to let go of things, even if it's for the better.
uid01021e9a.msg:004e:0x00001DCE:00f4:16=And look what good it did me? I couldn't even protect what matters most to me.
uid01021e9a.msg:000a:0x00001E1E:010c:17="Brother"?
uid01021e9a.msg:0033:0x00001E29:0118:18=Takechi Hanpeita of Tosa. They were sworn brothers.
uid01021e9a.msg:0030:0x00001E5D:0124:19=Takechi Hanpeita's his brother? So, 'zat mean...
uid01021e9a.msg:001a:0x00001E8E:0130:20=Hmm, should I tell him...?
uid01021e9a.msg:0063:0x00001EA9:013c:21=This guy's really the rep for the Tosa Loyalist Party: Sakamoto Ryoma. He's been using a fake name.
uid01021e9a.msg:0023:0x00001F0D:0148:22=Sakamoto Ryoma? <i>This</i> guy is?
uid01021e9a.msg:001b:0x00001F32:0160:23=This man is Sakamoto Ryoma.
uid01021e9a.msg:001c:0x00001F4F:0178:24=The hell's goin' on here...?
uid01021e9a.msg:0003:0x00001F6C:0184:25=Hm?
uid01021e9a.msg:000a:0x00001F70:0190:26=Say, uh—
uid01021e9a.msg:0030:0x00001F7C:01a8:27=Guy tosses us around and tells us how to feel...
uid01021e9a.msg:0019:0x00001FAE:01c0:28=Then he passes out on us.
uid01021e9a.msg:0014:0x00001FC9:01d8:29=Sakamoto Ryoma, huh?
uid01021e9a.msg:0018:0x00001FDE:01e4:30=What a stubborn drunk...
uid01021ea6.msg:002d:0x000034A4:0028:1=Hijikata, please. Tell me about Kondo's plan.
uid01021ea6.msg:005f:0x000034D2:0034:2=We knew that Ito Kashitaro had been wanting to take over the Shinsengumi since he first joined.
uid01021ea6.msg:0064:0x00003532:0040:3=Kondo-san intentionally let him roam free in order to keep watch and see who he allied himself with.
uid01021ea6.msg:0039:0x00003597:004c:4=It was all to reveal the true enemies of the Shinsengumi.
uid01021ea6.msg:0059:0x000035D1:0058:5=So Ito was bein' used as Chief Kondo's tool right from the get go, just for that purpose.
uid01021ea6.msg:0020:0x0000362B:0064:6=Yes, that would about sum it up.
uid01021ea6.msg:0026:0x0000364C:0070:7=And our man on the inside was Heisuke.
uid01021ea6.msg:0065:0x00003673:007c:8=Heisuke's from Shieikan. However, he'd also had the connection of learning military tactics from Ito.
uid01021ea6.msg:0077:0x000036D9:0088:9=Kondo-san had Heisuke get close to Ito a little over half a year ago, as a means to figure out his motives, apparently.
uid01021ea6.msg:002c:0x00003751:0094:10=Apparently? So ya weren't in the know, then?
uid01021ea6.msg:006c:0x0000377E:00a0:11=I wasn't. Still, Kondo-san never fails to surprise me. I can't imagine just how far ahead he was thinking...
uid01021ea6.msg:0074:0x000037EB:00ac:12=Sorry about all this, guys. I didn't want to keep it a secret, but there weren't a whole lot of chances to speak up.
uid01021ea6.msg:0053:0x00003860:00b8:13=So in order to find who Ito was connected to, Todo had to act the part, is that it?
uid01021ea6.msg:0064:0x000038B4:00c4:14=Righto. If you'd killed Ito-san right then and there, all my hard work would've gone out the window.
uid01021ea6.msg:0038:0x00003919:00d0:15=Man, that was rough. Been a while since I've shot a gun.
uid01021ea6.msg:002b:0x00003952:00dc:16=So we figure out who Ito's linked to, then?
uid01021ea6.msg:0027:0x0000397E:00e8:17=Well... It's Sakamoto Ryoma, from Tosa.
uid01021ea6.msg:0011:0x000039A6:00f4:18=Sakamoto Ryoma...
uid01021ea6.msg:001f:0x000039B8:0100:19=Damn, he just keeps poppin' up.
uid01021ea6.msg:002f:0x000039D8:010c:20=Ah, but I did get some other, even bigger info.
uid01021ea6.msg:000c:0x00003A08:0118:21=What's that?
uid01021ea6.msg:0060:0x00003A15:0124:22=Sakamoto Ryoma's planning to hold a meeting with the representatives of Choshu and Satsuma soon.
uid01021ea6.msg:002a:0x00003A76:0130:23=Ito-san was tasked with setting it all up.
uid01021ea6.msg:003c:0x00003AA1:013c:24=Choshu and Satsuma? So Katsura Kogoro and Saigo Kichinosuke.
uid01021ea6.msg:008a:0x00003ADE:0148:25=Was it the Great Restoration, maybe? Since that went down, Sakamoto Ryoma's been in a panic, what with his goal to end the Bakufu and all.
uid01021ea6.msg:0072:0x00003B69:0154:26=I see. So he wants to use the Satcho's desire to start a new government and delude them into taking on the Bakufu.
uid01021ea6.msg:003e:0x00003BDC:0160:27=He'd be starting a war and dragging all of Japan down with it.
uid01021ea6.msg:005f:0x00003C1B:016c:28=Yeah, but according to Ito-san that's just a cover, and Sakamoto Ryoma's got another objective.
uid01021ea6.msg:0033:0x00003C7B:0178:29=And that'd be, what? Killin' off Katsura and Saigo?
uid01021ea6.msg:0019:0x00003CAF:0184:30=No, it's not that simple.
uid01021ea6.msg:0094:0x00003CC9:0190:31=He wants the Satcho and the Bakufu at each other's throats, and once they're both exhausted, he'll use the Loyalist Party to crush them all at once.
uid01021ea6.msg:0024:0x00003D5E:019c:32=Two big birds 'n one big stone, huh?
uid01021ea6.msg:005f:0x00003D83:01a8:33=But neither Choshu nor Satsuma is that easy to fool. Do you really think they'll agree to meet?
uid01021ea6.msg:0060:0x00003DE3:01b4:34=That's the thing... It's why Ito-san was desperate for a way to get Choshu and Satsuma together.
uid01021ea6.msg:0050:0x00003E44:01c0:35=Top of that, he's got to prep a place that all three parties can meet in secret.
uid01021ea6.msg:0033:0x00003E95:01cc:36=So, Heisuke... Where's this Sakamoto Ryoma guy now?
uid01021ea6.msg:003d:0x00003EC9:01d8:37=Who knows? That's one thing Ito-san kept entirely to himself.
uid01021ea6.msg:005b:0x00003F07:01e4:38=That said, I do think Ryoma'd show himself, so long as the Satcho meeting actually happens.
uid01021ea6.msg:0032:0x00003F63:01f0:39=Right. Then, we'll just have to make sure it does.
uid01021ea6.msg:0004:0x00003F96:01fc:40=Huh?
uid01021ea6.msg:0054:0x00003F9B:0208:41=We set it in motion, then wait for the other Sakamoto Ryoma to show up as planned...
uid01021ea6.msg:0036:0x00003FF0:0214:42=You're sayin' ya wanna use the Satcho meeting as bait?
uid01021ea6.msg:004f:0x00004027:0220:43=Exactly. The man had Serizawa Kamo kill Pops then had even Kamo himself killed.
uid01021ea6.msg:002c:0x00004077:022c:44=This time, we'll get the jump on <i>him</i>.
uid01021ea6.msg:007f:0x000040A4:0238:45=But how do you suppose we get all three parties in place? The meeting won't happen without first convincing Choshu and Satsuma.
uid01021ea6.msg:0011:0x00004124:0244:46=Leave that to me.
uid01021ea6.msg:0018:0x00004136:0250:47=To you? You have a plan?
uid01021ea6.msg:004a:0x0000414F:025c:48=I've met both Katsura and Saigo before. I'll just have to go and ask them.
uid01021ea6.msg:000c:0x0000419A:0268:49=Hajime-chan?
uid01021ea6.msg:001e:0x000041A7:0274:50=You're gonna ask 'em directly?
uid01021ea6.msg:001c:0x000041C6:0280:51=Yeah, that's gonna be tough.
uid01021ea6.msg:0011:0x000041E3:028c:52=What do you mean?
uid01021ea6.msg:0063:0x000041F5:0298:53=Ito-san's Goryo Eji are all over town right now. And it's not like Saito-san's a fresh face either.
uid01021ea6.msg:0065:0x00004259:02a4:54=You run out to meet Saigo and Katsura, and it's only a matter of time before Ito-san gets wind of it.
uid01021ea6.msg:003d:0x000042BF:02b0:55=Well, when ya put it like that, I guess we're all stuck here.
uid01021ea6.msg:007e:0x000042FD:02bc:56=Everyone except Heisuke. But with the Great Restoration, an audience with either Saigo or Katsura will prove rather difficult.
uid01021ea6.msg:006f:0x0000437C:02c8:57=They're now in direct contact with the Emperor. Even if Heisuke went to meet them, they likely wouldn't bother.
uid01021ea6.msg:0071:0x000043EC:02d4:58=Dammit! But if we don't move now, we won't be able to stop him... We can't let Sakamoto Ryoma get away with this!
uid01021ea6.msg:0059:0x0000445E:02e0:59=We need to somehow pull Saigo and Katsura into the plan without alerting the Goryo Eji...
uid01021ea6.msg:0015:0x000044B8:02ec:60=The question is: how?
uid01021ea6.msg:0021:0x000044D0:0310:61=Why don't you let us handle that?
uid01021ea6.msg:000a:0x000044F3:0328:62=Nakaoka...
uid01021ea6.msg:003e:0x000044FE:0334:63=I just got back from Tosa, but I heard pretty much everything.
uid01021ea6.msg:0024:0x0000453D:0340:64=Looks like all the players are here.
uid01021ea6.msg:0023:0x00004565:0370:65=Otose... and Oryo? What's going on?
uid01021ea6.msg:0006:0x00004589:037c:66=Heheh.
uid01021eb0.msg:003d:0x00001F39:0034:1=Okay, the stage is set. Now we just need Saigo and Katsura...
uid01021eb0.msg:001f:0x00001F77:0040:2=Speaking of, leave Saigo to me.
uid01021eb0.msg:0013:0x00001F97:004c:3=You'll talk to him?
uid01021eb0.msg:003f:0x00001FAB:0058:4=I doubt Saigo would currently meet with someone he's never met.
uid01021eb0.msg:0073:0x00001FEB:0064:5=Maybe, but the Goryo Eji don't know my face, so unlike you guys, I can move about without drawing much attention...
uid01021eb0.msg:0047:0x0000205F:0070:6=That, and I've got a little something special to show our friend Saito.
uid01021eb0.msg:0012:0x000020A7:007c:7=Something special?
uid01021eb0.msg:003a:0x000020BA:0088:8=Yeah. The face of the man pretending to be Sakamoto Ryoma.
uid01021eb0.msg:0015:0x000020F9:00c4:9=Wait, what the hell!?
uid01021eb0.msg:005a:0x0000210F:00d0:10=This is what they call a photograph... What do you say, Sakamoto? This face take you back?
uid01021eb0.msg:001e:0x0000216A:00dc:11=Yeah... It's Takechi Hanpeita.
uid01021eb0.msg:0008:0x00002189:00e8:12=Who now?
uid01021eb0.msg:008e:0x00002192:00f4:13=He's like a brother to me, and the founder of the Tosa Loyalist Party. They said he'd committed seppuku in Tosa, but... I knew it wasn't true.
uid01021eb0.msg:000b:0x00002221:0100:14=That's him.
uid01021eb0.msg:0003:0x0000222D:010c:15=Hm?
uid01021eb0.msg:0022:0x00002231:0118:16=That's the Sakamoto Ryoma I met...
uid01021eb0.msg:0008:0x00002254:0124:17=Met how?
uid01021eb0.msg:0019:0x0000225D:0130:18=That's right. It was him.
uid01021eb0.msg:0062:0x00002277:013c:19=Hajime-chan... Did you know that this Takechi guy was goin' around callin' himself Sakamoto Ryoma?
uid01021eb0.msg:0054:0x000022DA:0148:20=I had heard it from Okada Izo. But I guess you can't get more solid proof than this.
uid01021eb0.msg:0049:0x0000232F:0154:21=It's my hope that this photograph will be enough to get Saigo interested.
uid01021eb0.msg:0038:0x00002379:0160:22=Now, it's likely Saigo already knows Ryoma's identity...
uid01021eb0.msg:0058:0x000023B2:016c:23=But I don't imagine too many in the Satcho know that Takechi's the face behind the name.
uid01021eb0.msg:0053:0x0000240B:0178:24=With luck, that'll catch Saigo's attention, at least enough for him to hear me out.
uid01021eb0.msg:0088:0x0000245F:0184:25=Yeah, that's not a bad idea. But what about Choshu? Unlike Saigo, we've no idea where Katsura might show up. There's no way to meet him.
uid01021eb0.msg:0064:0x000024E8:0190:26=There is one way... If we can get in touch with a woman named Ikumatsu, Katsura won't be far behind.
uid01021eb0.msg:0070:0x0000254D:019c:27=She's the okami at Matsunoi, a bar that Katsura's been running in secret. I've met him through her once already.
uid01021eb0.msg:0018:0x000025BE:01a8:28=Then, let me go get him.
uid01021eb0.msg:0008:0x000025D7:01b4:29=Heisuke.
uid01021eb0.msg:0061:0x000025E0:01c0:30=I can move around town more easily. And that photograph... Mind if I fill Katsura in on that too?
uid01021eb0.msg:0032:0x00002642:01cc:31=But ain't it yer job to suggest this place to Ito?
uid01021eb0.msg:003f:0x00002675:01d8:32=Hey, yeah. How're ya gonna explain runnin' out to meet Katsura?
uid01021eb0.msg:004c:0x000026B5:01e4:33=Not sure... Maybe I'll say I'm going out for a drink, and give 'em the slip.
uid01021eb0.msg:0064:0x00002702:01f0:34=Todo, you're treading dangerous waters here. Just be careful that Ito and the others don't catch on.
uid01021eb0.msg:000f:0x00002767:01fc:35=I will, I will.
uid01021eb0.msg:0048:0x00002777:0208:36=All right then, we should head back to the barracks before the sun sets.
uid01021eb0.msg:0042:0x000027C0:0214:37=That should help Nakaoka and Heisuke get around a little easier...
uid01021eba.msg:003e:0x00000340:0038:1=Oh, Hajime-san! Nakaoka-san's returned. He's waiting upstairs.
uid01021eba.msg:0050:0x00000380:0050:2=(For now, I can only pray that Nakaoka and Todo get things done on their end...)
uid01021eba.msg:004a:0x000003D1:005c:3=(I should probably do what I can till then. Maybe I'll stop by the house.)
uid01021eba.msg:0080:0x0000041C:0068:4=Taking a rest on your comfy futon here will help you pass the time, even though it might feel like it's only been a few seconds.
uid01021ebb.msg:0011:0x00000968:0038:1=What will you do?
uid01021ebb.msg:0015:0x0000097B:0050:2=I'll rest until noon.
uid01021ebb.msg:001c:0x00000992:0068:3=I'll rest until the evening.

uid01021ec7.msg:0005:0x00001934:0048:1=What?
uid01021ec7.msg:0086:0x0000193A:0054:2=Ito-han's a sinkin' ship at this point... Once Sakamoto Ryoma gets what he wants from me and the rest of the Goryo Eji, that'll be it.
uid01021ec7.msg:0062:0x000019C1:0060:3=And knowing that, I reckon I ought to switch over to Choshu or somewhere while the getting's good.
uid01021ec7.msg:000a:0x00001A24:006c:4=To Choshu?
uid01021ec7.msg:0070:0x00001A2F:0078:5=You guys seem pretty friendly with Katsura. Think you could put in a good word for me and the boys in the Fifth?
uid01021ec7.msg:0018:0x00001AA0:0084:6=Takeda, what are you...?
uid01021ec7.msg:0053:0x00001AB9:0090:7=Or would you rather join Todo and let me flip you around a bit...? Choice is yours.
uid01021ec7.msg:0010:0x00001B0E:00a8:8=Eee... S-Stop...
uid01021ec7.msg:006f:0x00001B1F:00b4:9=Ptew! Soft girly-girls' sweat just ain't for me. Nah, I prefer something a little firmer, like our boy Heisuke.
uid01021ec7.msg:0022:0x00001B91:00d8:10=You're making this a lot easier...
uid01021ec7.msg:0004:0x00001BB4:00e4:11=Huh?
uid01021ec7.msg:0057:0x00001BB9:00f0:12=I thought I'd just have to shut you up... But now I've got no problem cutting you down.
uid01021ec7.msg:0022:0x00001C12:0108:13=So, you want a piece of me, do ya?
uid01021ec7.msg:0019:0x00001C35:0114:14=You know damn well, I do.
uid01021ec7.msg:0049:0x00001C4F:0120:15=Right. Ah, what a waste... You know, I was really hopin' to let you live!
uid01021ec7.msg:005b:0x00001C9A:0138:16=These pistols here are what offed Inoue Genzaburo... I got 'em from Sakamoto Ryoma himself.
uid01021ec7.msg:0009:0x00001CF6:0144:17=What...!?
uid01021ec7.msg:007d:0x00001D00:0150:18=Auto-loading, high-caliber twin shooters. Fling that sword around all you want, it won't stand a chance against these babies.
uid01021ec7.msg:0016:0x00001D7E:015c:19=You can count on that.
uid01021ec7.msg:0035:0x00001D95:0168:20=Fine, then I guess those guns'll just have to go too.
uid01021ec7.msg:003a:0x00001DCB:0174:21=Don't blink. This'll be over in a flash. You ready to die?
uid01021ec7.msg:001d:0x00001E06:0180:22=I'm always ready... Bring it!
uid01021ec7.msg:0015:0x00001E25:0198:23=Dumbass! Say goodbye!
uid01021ec7.msg:0027:0x00001E3D:01bc:24=(I should hurry to Ikumatsu's place...)
uid01021ecc.msg:001d:0x00001958:0048:1=Saito-han! Is Saito-han here?
uid01021ecc.msg:001f:0x00001976:0054:2=Ikumatsu? Everything all right?
uid01021ecc.msg:0069:0x00001996:0060:3=I've got a message from Katsura-han, so I came to pass it on. He said he'll definitely be at the meeting.
uid01021ecc.msg:000e:0x00001A00:006c:4=Great, got it.
uid01021ecc.msg:0042:0x00001A0F:0078:5=I'm sorry about Todo-han... Katsura-han gives his regards as well.
uid01021ecc.msg:0036:0x00001A59:0090:6=You take care, Saito-han. Anyhow, if you'll excuse me.
uid01021ecc.msg:0011:0x00001A90:009c:7=Thanks, Ikumatsu.
uid01021ecc.msg:004c:0x00001AA3:00b4:8=(Everything's finally ready. Saigo and Katsura should be at Omiya by now...)

uid01021ecc.msg:0056:0x00001B7A:0138:11=(There's still some time, and there's no telling what'll happen. I'd better be ready.)
uid01021ecc.msg:0021:0x00001BD3:015c:12=Hajime-san, do you have a moment?
uid01021ecc.msg:0010:0x00001BF5:0168:13=Something wrong?
uid01021ecc.msg:0047:0x00001C06:0174:14=I'll be working at Omiya tomorrow night, so I'll be there ahead of you.
uid01021ecc.msg:0005:0x00001C4E:0180:15=What?
uid01021ecc.msg:006d:0x00001C54:018c:16=Once things are settled inside, I'll light a fire downstairs. The smoke'll be the signal to make your way in.
uid01021ecc.msg:0016:0x00001CC2:0198:17=Will you be all right?
uid01021ecc.msg:0046:0x00001CD9:01a4:18=I'll be fine. This is about the only thing I can help with, after all.
uid01021ecc.msg:0024:0x00001D20:01b0:19=You've done plenty, Oryo. Thank you.
uid01021ecc.msg:004c:0x00001D45:01bc:20=There's still time 'til tomorrow night. Might wanna get ready while you can.
uid01021ecc.msg:0080:0x00001D98:0210:21=Taking a rest on your comfy futon here will help you pass the time, even though it might feel like it's only been a few seconds.

uid01021f83.msg:0030:0x00000D3B:0044:2=Why does Okita seem to care so much about Inoue?
uid01021f83.msg:0074:0x00000D6C:0050:3=No use asking us, sir. We just follow the captain's orders. He's not the kind of guy to share his motives, you know.
uid01021f83.msg:0038:0x00000DE1:005c:4=I guess he's got you pretty well-disciplined, then, huh?
uid01021f83.msg:006b:0x00000E1A:0068:5=(I'm supposed to be headed for the harbor. I hope the First Division isn't terrorizing the rest of town...)

uid01021f83.msg:004f:0x00000EC5:008c:7=Not so sure I can, though. I've heard you were seen near the harbor last night.
uid01021f83.msg:002d:0x00000F15:0098:8=Maybe you need some help jogging your memory?
uid01021f83.msg:0012:0x00000F43:00a4:9=Aieee! Please, no!
uid01021f83.msg:0018:0x00000F56:00b0:10=What are you guys doing?
uid01021f83.msg:0055:0x00000F6F:00bc:11=Oh, Captain Saito. We've been assigned to find the culprit in Captain Inoue's murder.
uid01021f83.msg:0052:0x00000FC5:00c8:12=Well, the way you're going about it reflects badly on the Shinsengumi. Let him go.
uid01021f83.msg:0036:0x00001018:00d4:13=Captain Okita was very clear with our current mission.
uid01021f83.msg:006f:0x0000104F:00e0:14=Specifically, he told us to use any means necessary. Please refrain from interfering with our captain's orders.
uid01021f83.msg:0018:0x000010BF:00ec:15=And if I were to refuse?
uid01021f83.msg:0050:0x000010D8:00f8:16=We only serve one true captain. If you insist on interfering with the mission...
uid01021f83.msg:0038:0x00001129:0104:17=Heh, you're all as ill-tempered as your captain is, huh?
uid01021f83.msg:0043:0x00001162:0110:18=Fine by me. I've got experience giving mad dogs their training now.
uid01021f83.msg:0019:0x000011A6:011c:19=Hmph! Take him down, men!
uid01021f88.msg:0004:0x000007A8:0038:1=Gah!
uid01021f88.msg:004c:0x000007AD:0044:2=You're not the only ones trying to find this killer. Now, behave yourselves.

uid01021f88.msg:0038:0x000008A0:008c:7=You must've really had a grudge against Captain Inoue...
uid01021f88.msg:005f:0x000008D9:0098:8=So much so that you went out and got a new type of gun that could take him out from a distance!
uid01021f88.msg:001f:0x00000939:00a4:9=Wha—! What are you on about!?
uid01021f88.msg:0013:0x00000959:00b0:10=Hey, that's enough.
uid01021f88.msg:004d:0x0000096D:00bc:11=Oh, Captain Saito. Please refrain from interfering with our captain's orders.
uid01021f88.msg:0038:0x000009BB:00c8:12=Damn, how's he get you all to even respond the same way?
uid01021f88.msg:004f:0x000009F4:00d4:13=Sorry, but I'm jumping ahead in this conversation to when I stop you. By force.
uid01021f88.msg:001b:0x00000A44:00e0:14=Very well... Try your best!

uid01021f8c.msg:0016:0x0000088C:0090:5=Ahhh! Please, no more!
uid01021f8c.msg:003e:0x000008A3:009c:6=Hmph! We know you're an informant with numerous loyalist ties.
uid01021f8c.msg:0043:0x000008E2:00a8:7=Are you trying to say you don't have <i>any</i> information for us?
uid01021f8c.msg:0029:0x00000926:00b4:8=Really! I don't know anything about this!
uid01021f8c.msg:0016:0x00000950:00c0:9=That's enough of that.
uid01021f8c.msg:004d:0x00000967:00cc:10=Oh, Captain Saito. Please refrain from interfering with our captain's orders.
uid01021f8c.msg:004e:0x000009B5:00d8:11=Man, he really does have you all working from some kind of script, doesn't he?
uid01021f8c.msg:0068:0x00000A04:00e4:12=I already know your division doesn't listen to reason. You'd better get ready for some tough convincing.
uid01021f8c.msg:0041:0x00000A6D:00f0:13=Hmph! Just because you're a captain doesn't mean we'll hold back!
uid01021f8f.msg:0013:0x00000711:0054:1=God, he's strong...
uid01021f8f.msg:0040:0x00000725:0060:2=(I've wasted too much time here... I should hurry to Mukurogai.)

uid01021f8f.msg:0005:0x000007CC:009c:6=What?
uid01021f8f.msg:0045:0x000007D2:00a8:7=We received word that you've been interfering with our investigation.
uid01021f8f.msg:002b:0x00000818:00b4:8=Now, our orders are to subdue you on sight.
uid01021f8f.msg:0036:0x00000844:00c0:9=Just once I'd love to hear something new from you lot.
uid01021f8f.msg:0062:0x0000087B:00cc:10=I have to say, I really don't want to make the Shinsengumi look any worse out in public like this.

uid01021fce.msg:0054:0x00000A24:0068:1=Guess I kinda dragged you all over the place. Why don't we end with Kiyomizu Temple?
uid01021fce.msg:0048:0x00000A79:0074:2=Okay. But I gotta ask, Hajime-san. Is there anything you're wishing for?
uid01021fce.msg:001e:0x00000AC2:0080:3=Heh. Call it a secret for now.
uid01021fce.msg:007d:0x00000AE2:0098:4=(Great food, drinks, and singing. There might even be time to dance. If we go to Nichibuza, I can show her all I've learned.)
uid01021fce.msg:0028:0x00000B61:00b0:5=Mm... Think that sake's gone to my head.
uid01021fce.msg:0051:0x00000B8A:00bc:6=Hajime-san, if you pass out in the middle of the road, I'm not carrying you back.
uid01021fce.msg:0037:0x00000BDC:00c8:7=(I feel like singing. Maybe we should go to Utamaruya.)
uid01021fce.msg:0010:0x00000C15:00e0:8=Enjoy your meal?
uid01021fce.msg:0059:0x00000C26:00ec:9=Mm. It was very tasty. But... I don't think I've ever seen you eat so much, Hajime-san...
uid01021fce.msg:0028:0x00000C80:00f8:10=Certainly not any of the food I've made.
uid01021fce.msg:0005:0x00000CA9:0104:11=Um...
uid01021fce.msg:001a:0x00000CAF:0110:12=Hehe. Well, where to next?
uid01021fce.msg:002d:0x00000CCA:011c:13=(Hmm... Maybe we could get drinks somewhere.)
uid01021fce.msg:0020:0x00000CF9:0134:14=How 'bout we stroll around town?
uid01021fce.msg:0032:0x00000D1A:0140:15=Anywhere's fine with me. Lead the way, Hajime-san.
uid01021fce.msg:002b:0x00000D4D:014c:16=(We should probably grab a bite somewhere.)
uid01021feb.msg:0036:0x00000700:0028:1=It's, um, my treat, of course. Have whatever you like.
uid01021feb.msg:002a:0x00000737:0034:2=Oh. Hajime-san... Are you sure about that?
uid01021feb.msg:0015:0x00000762:0040:3=Heh. Yeah, go for it.
uid01021feb.msg:0005:0x00000778:004c:4=Hehe.
uid01021feb.msg:004a:0x0000077E:0058:5=This is a little embarrassing, you know. Dining out, just the two of us...
uid01021feb.msg:004c:0x000007CC:0088:6=No need to pay today, Saito-san. You're always taking care of us, after all.
uid01021feb.msg:001c:0x00000819:0094:7=You sure? I appreciate that.
uid01021feb.msg:0027:0x00000836:00a0:8=I bet you're relieved, huh, Hajime-san?
uid01021feb.msg:0011:0x0000085E:00ac:9=Heh. A bit, yeah.
uid01021fec.msg:0036:0x000006D0:0028:1=It's, um, my treat, of course. Have whatever you like.
uid01021fec.msg:002a:0x00000707:0034:2=Oh. Hajime-san... Are you sure about that?

uid01021fed.msg:0010:0x00000860:0028:1=Here, I'll pour.
uid01021fed.msg:001e:0x00000871:0034:2=Oh, thank you. What about you?
uid01021fed.msg:0017:0x00000890:0040:3=Hm, don't mind if I do!
uid01021fed.msg:0053:0x000008AC:007c:4=Oh, Saito-san. Rare sight to see you with company, and such lovely company at that.
uid01021fed.msg:000d:0x00000900:0088:5=Got me there.
uid01021fed.msg:0047:0x0000090E:0094:6=I'll be leaving Kyo for a while. I wanted to say thanks for everything.
uid01021fed.msg:0061:0x00000956:00a0:7=Oh, that's a shame... Well then, as a parting gift, I'll be covering your tab today, so drink up.
uid01021fed.msg:000d:0x000009B8:00ac:8=Hm? You sure?
uid01021fed.msg:0035:0x000009C6:00b8:9=Please. It's the least I could do for you, Saito-san.
uid01021fed.msg:002f:0x000009FC:00c4:10=You two oughta have some fun. Enjoy yourselves.
uid01021fed.msg:003e:0x00000A2C:00d0:11=Hehe, don't you think maybe she's being a little too generous?
uid01021fed.msg:0031:0x00000A6B:00dc:12=Heh. I'm sure she just wants you to feel welcome.
uid01021fee.msg:0025:0x00000534:0038:1=What did you think? Did I sound okay?
uid01021fee.msg:003b:0x0000055A:0044:2=Hehe, you sounded real good. Everyone here got all excited.
uid01021fee.msg:001e:0x00000596:0050:3=Oh, nice. That's good to hear.
uid01021fee.msg:0047:0x000005B5:005c:4=You know, you're pretty popular, Hajime-san. Everyone in Kyo loves you.
uid01021fee.msg:001d:0x000005FD:0068:5=Heh. I don't know about that.
uid01021fee.msg:0017:0x0000061C:0080:6=Maybe I'll sing a song.
uid01021fee.msg:002d:0x00000634:008c:7=Wow, how exciting! I'd love to hear you sing.
uid01021ff2.msg:0016:0x00000594:0038:1=So what did you think?
uid01021ff2.msg:0042:0x000005AB:0044:2=Honestly... I thought you were amazing! I couldn't help but watch.
uid01021ff2.msg:0052:0x000005EE:0050:3=I'd always imagined you'd be out gambling all the time, so I was really surprised.
uid01021ff2.msg:001c:0x00000641:005c:4=Heh, guess I did okay, then.
uid01021ff2.msg:0021:0x0000065E:0068:5=Haha, more than okay, Hajime-san.
uid01021ff2.msg:0021:0x00000681:0080:6=Can you really dance, Hajime-san?
uid01021ff2.msg:0023:0x000006A3:008c:7=Who knows, but I'll give it a shot.
uid01021ff6.msg:002e:0x00001BB0:0058:1=Aren't you tired? That was a pretty long walk.
uid01021ff6.msg:0048:0x00001BDF:0064:2=Oh, no, I'm totally fine. This is nothing compared to a day at Teradaya.
uid01021ff6.msg:0047:0x00001C28:0070:3=I figured you'd be tired, what with us running all over town like that.
uid01021ff6.msg:0024:0x00001C70:007c:4=Still... This has been a lot of fun.
uid01021ff6.msg:003a:0x00001C95:0088:5=Makes me wish we could do this kind of thing all the time.
uid01021ff6.msg:000a:0x00001CD0:0094:6=Hey, Oryo.
uid01021ff6.msg:000f:0x00001CDC:00ac:7=Hm? What is it?
uid01021ff6.msg:0028:0x00001CEC:00b8:8=Thanks for everything. Truly, I mean it.
uid01021ff6.msg:004f:0x00001D15:00c4:9=The only reason I've been able to do anything on my own here is because of you.
uid01021ff6.msg:0032:0x00001D66:00dc:10=And even knowing that, I never really said thanks.
uid01021ff6.msg:0024:0x00001D99:00e8:11=I had to make sure I did that today.
uid01021ff6.msg:0034:0x00001DBF:0100:12=For all I know, this might be the last chance I get.
uid01021ff6.msg:000d:0x00001DF4:010c:13=Hajime-san...
uid01021ff6.msg:0048:0x00001E02:0118:14=A lot's about to change, now that the Bakufu's gone, and for the better.
uid01021ff6.msg:003e:0x00001E4B:0124:15=So please, Oryo, I hope you and Otose look out for each other.
uid01021ff6.msg:0012:0x00001E8B:013c:16=...Don't say that.
uid01021ff6.msg:0003:0x00001E9E:0148:17=Hm?
uid01021ff6.msg:0027:0x00001EA2:0154:18=I can already guess what's coming next.
uid01021ff6.msg:0030:0x00001ECA:0160:19=But I won't hear it... Not from you, Hajime-san.
uid01021ff6.msg:0007:0x00001EFB:016c:20=Oryo...
uid01021ff6.msg:0057:0x00001F03:0178:21=Maybe I don't have a whole lot of room to talk, seeing as I lied to you and everything.
uid01021ff6.msg:0040:0x00001F5B:0184:22=Still, from here on out... I don't ever want to leave your side.
uid01021ff6.msg:003c:0x00001F9C:0190:23=So why are you making it seem like I'll never see you again?
uid01021ff6.msg:003a:0x00001FD9:019c:24=You're comin' back to Kyo once you're done in Tosa, right?
uid01021ff6.msg:0019:0x0000201C:01c0:25=Please, you just have to.
uid01021ff6.msg:005d:0x00002036:01cc:26=I'll be waiting for you. I'll wait as long as it takes for you to come back safe, Hajime-san.
uid01021ff6.msg:0031:0x00002094:01d8:27=Promise me, Hajime-san. Promise you'll come back.
uid01021ff6.msg:0015:0x000020C6:01e4:28=All right. I promise.
uid01021ff6.msg:0053:0x000020DC:01f0:29=I'm holding you to that. If you lie to me, then... I'm never cooking for you again.
uid01021ff6.msg:0005:0x00002130:01fc:30=Deal.
uid01022020.msg:0059:0x00000B05:0044:1=Over here, Deputy Chief! There are forty of them inside! They're armed and fighting back!
uid01022020.msg:0074:0x00000B60:005c:2=Saito-kun! Remember what I said—Yoshida Toshimaro and Katsura Kogoro are priority. Let the troops handle the rest.
uid01022020.msg:0054:0x00000BD8:008c:3=(Nakaoka... I guess he wasn't able to convince Toshimaro and the others to lay low.)

uid010c12d3.msg:0033:0x00000FEC:012c:5=I'm with the Eighth Division, Captain Todo's troop.
uid010c12d3.msg:001d:0x00001020:0138:6=Right. So, what did you want?
uid010c12d3.msg:0049:0x0000103E:0144:7=Did the captain share any details with you about another recent deserter?
uid010c12d3.msg:001b:0x00001088:0150:8=Another one? No, he didn't.
uid010c12d3.msg:001e:0x000010A4:015c:9=I knew it. Come on, Captain...
uid010c12d3.msg:0078:0x000010C3:0168:10=Well, during the mess that was Captain Yamanami's desertion, another trooper in the Third Division also made his escape.
uid010c12d3.msg:0035:0x0000113C:0174:11=Ah, Third Division—so he would've been one of mine.
uid010c12d3.msg:007e:0x00001172:0180:12=Yes, sir. His name is Akimoto, and we're not sure where he's gone. The investigation team is still trying to track him down...
uid010c12d3.msg:0064:0x000011F1:018c:13=But as soon as his location is known, you've been ordered to capture him, as Third Division Captain.
uid010c12d3.msg:003b:0x00001256:0198:14=Oh, so I'm starting off by cleaning up the last guy's mess.
uid010c12d3.msg:006f:0x00001292:01a4:15=Unfortunately yes, sir... And Captain Todo was supposed to be the one to inform you, but you see how that went.
uid010c12d3.msg:0042:0x00001302:01b0:16=That's all right, I've got my orders—find the deserter, Akimoto.
uid010c12d3.msg:002f:0x00001345:01bc:17=And I'll return to my own duties. Best of luck.
uid010c12d3.msg:0048:0x00001377:01e0:18=(Todo's giving me a tour of the barracks—I should follow him for now.)

uid010c12f7.msg:0022:0x0000173E:0188:11=The hell is wrong with you people?
uid010c12f7.msg:005a:0x00001761:0194:12=Do you really gotta ask? You're in Mukurogai, dumbass. We do this shit day in and day out.

uid010c12f7.msg:006d:0x00001890:01dc:17=You think we're afraid of you? We'll just take the money off your corpse. Makes no difference to me! Get 'im!

uid010c130a.msg:002d:0x00002ED6:0054:2=What good is it to kill foreigners like this?
uid010c130a.msg:0041:0x00002F04:0060:3=What good? Easy, we don't need 'em, and we're getting rid of 'em!
uid010c130a.msg:0086:0x00002F4D:0078:4=That's a pretty big statement. There's a lot to be learned from other cultures, you know. It could help Japan for generations to come.
uid010c130a.msg:0051:0x00002FD4:0084:5=Get real. The only people that are gonna help are the Japanese, plain and simple.
uid010c130a.msg:0054:0x00003026:0090:6=You try to get in the way of that, and you'll wind up buried along with the old man.
uid010c130a.msg:003f:0x0000307C:00a8:7=We'll hit you with everything we have. And don't you forget it.

uid010c130a.msg:0013:0x000030E3:00d8:10=Yes, thanks to you.
uid010c130a.msg:0032:0x000030F7:00e4:11=Please, call me Creek. I teach agriculture nearby.
uid010c130a.msg:003b:0x0000312A:00f0:12=I'm Saito... I'm sorry for my fellow countrymen's behavior.
uid010c130a.msg:0038:0x00003166:00fc:13=I hope this won't change your mind about the rest of us.
uid010c130a.msg:0065:0x0000319F:0108:14=Heh, nonsense. You're Japanese too after all, and you stuck your neck out for me, no questions asked.
uid010c130a.msg:0046:0x00003205:0114:15=...I don't really understand their hate for those of us from overseas.
uid010c130a.msg:0057:0x0000324C:0120:16=But I'm sure they'll understand me once they see how much I care. I truly believe that.
uid010c130a.msg:0041:0x000032A4:012c:17=Fact of the matter is, they want to do what's best for Japan too.
uid010c130a.msg:0076:0x000032E6:0138:18=...You might be right. Still, it's kind of sad that people who believe in the same thing can't believe in one another.
uid010c130a.msg:007f:0x0000335D:0144:19=Yes. But I would just love for men like them to see eye to eye with men like me one day. In fact, nothing would please me more.
uid010c130a.msg:004f:0x000033DD:0150:20=Well, it's a noble thought, but you shouldn't put yourself in danger like that.
uid010c130a.msg:0076:0x0000342D:015c:21=I'd try to avoid being reckless from now on. If you see those guys again, run. Not everyone's willing to hear you out.
uid010c130a.msg:005d:0x000034A4:0168:22=Of course... Thank you, Saito-san. It's nice to know there are people like you out there too.
uid010c130a.msg:0009:0x00003502:0174:23=Farewell.

uid010c130a.msg:0058:0x00003576:01e0:27=...Well, what do you know? Just the man we've been lookin' for, and he came right to us.
uid010c130a.msg:0076:0x000035D1:0204:28=We are the Kakumei Joui. And if you ain't from around here, we've got no choice but to make sure you're dead and gone.
uid010c130a.msg:0020:0x00003649:021c:29=Now, what kind of logic is that?
uid010c130a.msg:0005:0x0000366A:0228:30=Huh!?
uid010c130a.msg:0054:0x00003670:0234:31=My name is Creek. I've come to Japan to share my country's knowledge of agriculture.
uid010c130a.msg:0061:0x000036C5:0240:32=Frankly, this place is a tad behind... Little help from me will do wonders for this place, truly.

uid010c130a.msg:0068:0x0000394E:02a0:40=Word on the street is a bunch of extremists have been going around killing foreigners. Is that you guys?

uid010c130a.msg:001c:0x000039C6:02b8:42=Then, I'll have to stop you.

uid010c130a.msg:006d:0x00003A60:02f4:46=No, I'm serious! Foreigners aren't exactly welcome around here right now, especially not by the Kakumei Joui.

uid010c130a.msg:0053:0x00003ADA:030c:48="Kakumei Joui." They've been killing pretty much any and all foreigners as of late.
uid010c130a.msg:00aa:0x00003B2E:0318:49=They're a group of "Sonno Joui" idealists who essentially see foreigners as pests. If you're not from around here, then you'll likely get a sword or two pointed your way.
uid010c130a.msg:0074:0x00003BD9:0324:50=Heh... Well, let them point. I love this country, and I'll give everything I've got for it till my very last breath.
uid010c130a.msg:0059:0x00003C4E:0330:51=Surely these idealists will understand that... Perhaps they just need someone to explain.

uid010c130a.msg:005d:0x00003D91:036c:55=...That kid worries too much. Anyhow, I should probably get home. Maybe I'll take a shortcut.

uid010c133b.msg:001a:0x0000897D:01a0:9=No, nothing in particular.
uid010c133b.msg:0065:0x00008998:01ac:10=I get it. Can't do business with a fink on your tail. We're square, just come back when you lose 'em.

uid010c133b.msg:0068:0x00008FF8:03f8:44=...Hate to admit it, but yours truly screwed up a deal big-time. The syndicate's trying to hunt me down.

uid010c133b.msg:005b:0x00009086:0410:46=Well, I can't run forever. Only a matter of time before they're fishing me outta the river.
uid010c133b.msg:0020:0x000090E2:041c:47=I see... That's... That's tough.
uid010c133b.msg:0051:0x00009103:0428:48=Our partnership might've been short-lived, friendo, but I'm glad to have met you.
uid010c133b.msg:004f:0x00009155:0434:49=I hope you'll think of me now and then... Remember me for who I was, all right?
uid010c133b.msg:003c:0x000091A5:0440:50=Hey, don't give up. Is there no way you can get out of this?

uid010c133b.msg:0013:0x0000920F:0458:52=What? Just name it.

uid010c133b.msg:0041:0x0000923D:047c:55=Yeah, if I can scrape up some primo carrots, they'll let me walk.
uid010c133b.msg:0058:0x0000927F:0488:56=Not sure if you knew this, but you can buy carrots in town. I'll go pick up a few and...
uid010c133b.msg:004f:0x000092D8:0494:57=No, see, I need—er, well, I guess we call 'em "carrots" here in Japan, but...

uid010c133b.msg:0041:0x00009382:04b8:60=Do I ever, but good luck finding it out here... Not on your life.
uid010c133b.msg:004f:0x000093C4:04c4:61=No, you can still get it here. It's just harder to get than carrots, obviously.

uid010c133b.msg:0047:0x000094D7:04f4:65=You got a death wish, friendo? I can't guarantee your safety, you know.

uid010c133b.msg:0079:0x00009AA8:06c8:93=All right... that's good. Some people've been sticking their noses where they shouldn't, catching themselves a big whiff.

uid010c133b.msg:006f:0x0000AE12:0cf8:192=Of course, I won't expect a free run here, either. You get a hold of the goods, and I'll set you up with 2 ryo.
uid010c133b.msg:0032:0x0000AE82:0d04:193=2 ryo? For 10 tomatoes? What kind of deal is this?
uid010c133b.msg:0042:0x0000AEB5:0d10:194=Unless you're keen on losing your head, it's better you don't ask.

uid010c1369.msg:0053:0x0000129B:0070:2=I guess this whole time, that man was waiting for an opportunity to steal from you.
uid010c1369.msg:0063:0x000012EF:007c:3=He must've been carefully studying the merchandise... Planning which streets to take once he ran...
uid010c1369.msg:004c:0x00001353:0088:4=But because of your devotion to customer service, he never found an opening.
uid010c1369.msg:0073:0x000013A0:0094:5=My goodness. It's true, under normal circumstances I would never dream of relieving myself with a customer waiting!
uid010c1369.msg:0044:0x00001414:00a0:6=Haha! It seems my fidelity to my customers was this thief's undoing!
uid010c1369.msg:002e:0x00001459:00ac:7=Heh. Guess it pays to take pride in your work.
uid010c1369.msg:0048:0x00001488:00b8:8=Oh, but, sir, it would all have been for nothing had you not intervened.
uid010c1369.msg:0042:0x000014D1:00c4:9=Now please, you must come inside so that I may thank you properly.
uid010c1369.msg:0016:0x00001516:00e8:10=(Damn it. I lost him.)
uid010c1369.msg:0022:0x0000152D:00f4:11=(I should head back to the store.)
uid010c1369.msg:001e:0x00001554:0130:12=Saito-sama, are you all right?
uid010c1369.msg:0035:0x00001573:013c:13=I'm fine. I'm sorry I couldn't catch that shoplifter.
uid010c1369.msg:0064:0x000015AA:0154:14=Ah, sir, worry not. Our would-be thief just so happened to run straight into some patrolling doshin.
uid010c1369.msg:0055:0x0000160F:0160:15=In fact, the man is something of a serial larcenist, whom they've been searching for.
uid010c1369.msg:0015:0x00001665:016c:16=He's been taken away.
uid010c1369.msg:0014:0x0000167B:0178:17=Huh, how about that.
uid010c1369.msg:001e:0x00001690:0184:18=I am in your debt, Saito-sama.
uid010c1369.msg:004e:0x000016AF:0190:19=I don't know about that. When it came down to it, I wasn't able to do my part.
uid010c1369.msg:007f:0x000016FE:019c:20=Nonsense! It was only due to your relentless pursuit at the thief's heels that he couldn't see the doshin in front of his nose.
uid010c1369.msg:002d:0x0000177E:01a8:21=This wouldn't have been possible without you.
uid010c1369.msg:0042:0x000017B3:01c0:22=Now please, you must come inside so that I may thank you properly.
uid010c1370.msg:003e:0x000023A4:0078:1=Well, Saito-san, everyone had a great time, all thanks to you.
uid010c1370.msg:003c:0x000023E3:0084:2=In fact, you seem to have built quite a stable of fans here.

uid010c1370.msg:002f:0x00002428:009c:4=Yeah, and you can count me as one of them, too.
uid010c1370.msg:0087:0x00002458:00a8:5=Ever since you started coming here, it's just been so much livelier... It's nice to enjoy ourselves despite our surroundings, you know?

uid010c1370.msg:005e:0x0000263D:0144:16=They sure have taken a shine to you, Saito-san. Don't forget to come back and play them, okay?
uid010c1370.msg:000b:0x0000269C:0150:17=Sure thing.
uid010c1370.msg:000e:0x000026A9:0168:18=Oh, Saito-san.

uid010c1370.msg:005f:0x000026BD:0180:20=Sorry to spring this on you, but do you think you could give the advanced table a go right now?
uid010c1370.msg:0013:0x0000271D:018c:21=The advanced table?
uid010c1370.msg:008a:0x00002731:0198:22=Yeah, their competition's thinned out recently. I don't know if it's because they're getting shunned, or if they just got too good, but...
uid010c1370.msg:004c:0x000027BC:01a4:23=Anyway, if you feel like it, would you do me a favor and pull up over there?
uid010c1370.msg:0014:0x00002809:01b0:24=Yeah, I can do that.
uid010c1370.msg:002a:0x0000281E:01bc:25=Some real good action on the tables today.
uid010c1370.msg:0017:0x00002849:01c8:26=Yeah, I know I had fun.
uid010c1370.msg:0039:0x00002861:01d4:27=And I have a pretty good time just watching you all, too.
uid010c1370.msg:0010:0x0000289B:01e0:28=Glad to hear it.

uid010c13b8.msg:0052:0x000043D6:0044:2=Well, maybe you should run a legitimate one instead of just trying to scam people.
uid010c13b8.msg:006b:0x00004429:0050:3=You're right, sir. From now on, I'll be more forthcoming with clients and keep this place on the up-and-up.

uid010c13d7.msg:0034:0x00002364:0094:4=I'm not really sure. I guess it depends on the bear?
uid010c13d7.msg:0069:0x00002399:00a0:5=Okay! Then I'll be a powerful samurai when I grow up and protect people from bear attacks, just like you!

uid010c13d7.msg:0041:0x00002513:0118:13=Samurai don't fib? Okay, I promise to tell the truth from now on.
uid010c13d7.msg:0048:0x00002555:0124:14=So long, sir! When I become a powerful samurai, let's have a duel, okay?
uid010c13d7.msg:001b:0x0000259E:0130:15=Heh. Looking forward to it.
uid010c13d7.msg:0061:0x000025BB:0148:16=(I can't believe I had to fight a bear. Seems like the world's getting more dangerous every day.)

uid010c13d7.msg:0043:0x000026A8:01a8:19=This boy-who-cried-bear routine of yours is getting awful tiresome.
uid010c13d7.msg:003f:0x000026EC:01b4:20=I was fibbing last time, okay? But this time I swear it's true.
uid010c13d7.msg:0026:0x0000272C:01c0:21=Hey. Did you actually see a bear, kid?

uid010c1404.msg:0044:0x0000764F:0090:3=Haha. Though with all this time, I am still nothing compared to you.

uid010c1404.msg:004a:0x000077FD:0144:16=We were really mean to you! We laughed at you for wanting to be a samurai.
uid010c1404.msg:0042:0x00007848:0150:17=But you still came and rescued us. We were wrong, and we're sorry!

uid010c140d.msg:0061:0x0000317B:00cc:8=The more I doubt that I am walking the right path. Or if my path will ever reach its destination.

uid010c140d.msg:0052:0x00003811:0294:37=Yes, sensay! I know I am still weak, but please allow me this chance to fight you!

uid010c140d.msg:0053:0x00003891:02c4:40=I was awful... I stand no chance against you. Is this... because I am not Japanese?
uid010c140d.msg:0035:0x000038EC:02dc:41=I have trained, but you are so much stronger, sensay!
uid010c140d.msg:0030:0x00003922:02e8:42=Please! How can I improve my way with the sword?
uid010c140d.msg:0034:0x00003953:02f4:43=To be honest, Tom, I sensed a lot of doubt from you.
uid010c140d.msg:000e:0x00003988:0300:44=Doubt, sensay?
uid010c140d.msg:004c:0x00003997:030c:45=You told me that you were willing to do anything to become a samurai, right?
uid010c140d.msg:0013:0x000039E4:0318:46=Yes! Hai! Anything!
uid010c140d.msg:0069:0x000039F8:0324:47=I get the feeling that somewhere deep in your heart, you've already given up because you're not Japanese.
uid010c140d.msg:001f:0x00003A69:033c:48=You... are correct. Absolutely.
uid010c140d.msg:005d:0x00003A89:0348:49=Part of me has told myself that the reason I have not succeeded is because of my nationality.
uid010c140d.msg:0044:0x00003AE7:0354:50=And you saw this doubt in my very swordplay. I am truly embarrassed.
uid010c140d.msg:001f:0x00003B2C:0360:51=Tom, you have a choice to make.
uid010c140d.msg:0040:0x00003B4C:036c:52=You can stay the course and keep training to become a samurai...
uid010c140d.msg:0037:0x00003B8D:0378:53=Or decide right now that it's not to be, and walk away.
uid010c140d.msg:005c:0x00003BC5:0384:54=I'm willing to work with you, but there's also strength to be found in knowing when to quit.
uid010c140d.msg:0009:0x00003C29:039c:55=Sensay...
uid010c140d.msg:0034:0x00003C33:03a8:56=I can not give up! I have nothing <i>to</i> give up!
uid010c140d.msg:006d:0x00003C68:03b4:57=I will not walk away from my dream until I have tried! Tried so many times that nothing remains inside of me!
uid010c140d.msg:000a:0x00003CD6:03c0:58=All right.
uid010c140d.msg:0053:0x00003CE1:03cc:59=There will be no more doubt in my sword! Japanese or not, I will become a sammerai!
uid010c140d.msg:0067:0x00003D35:03d8:60=But... my technique is still very far below yours. I should train on my own until I am ready once more.
uid010c140d.msg:0050:0x00003D9D:03e4:61=When I return to the front of this dojo, it will be to ask you to face me again!
uid010c140d.msg:0047:0x00003DEE:03f0:62=Okay. Just remember, this place is only available to us during the day.
uid010c140d.msg:0068:0x00003E36:03fc:63=Then I will train by myself in the nighttime, and return here by the sun! Until then, sensay! Sayanarra!

uid010c140d.msg:0040:0x00003EC3:0444:65=You said you've been training on your own, right? Are you ready?
uid010c140d.msg:0055:0x00003F04:0450:66=Yes, sensay! I am sure I have much to learn still, but I will show you what I can do!
uid010c140d.msg:0019:0x00003F5A:045c:67=Heh. All right, let's go!
uid010c1419.msg:003c:0x00000B7D:0034:1=Heh, you got a real pair on you! And I don't mean literally!

uid010c1419.msg:0040:0x00000D22:00b8:12=(This is getting messy... I should hurry back to the bathhouse.)

uid010c1422.msg:0013:0x00009405:01a8:22=A tanka, of course.
uid010c1422.msg:0027:0x00009419:01b4:23=A tanka... But why write a poem for me?
uid010c1422.msg:0045:0x00009441:01c0:24=Simply because it's how I feel... That I'm burning with love for you.
uid010c1422.msg:0089:0x00009487:01cc:25=So much so that even if I lost my sight, I'd remember you perfectly. I'll always remember you, even if... you don't want to see me again.
uid010c1422.msg:0009:0x00009511:01d8:26=Uhhh-huh.

uid010c1422.msg:0064:0x00009644:022c:32=I've been really focused on the arms lately. Lifted a lot just the other day. You see those muscles?

uid010c1422.msg:002f:0x00009884:02a4:41=But the thing is, I can't be with you that way!

uid010c1422.msg:007d:0x000098BE:02bc:43=Because I look up to you. You are so kind, you care for others... You're dependable even though you are a bit scatterbrained.
uid010c1422.msg:0031:0x0000993C:02c8:44=All these things make me admire you as my senpai.
uid010c1422.msg:003c:0x0000996E:02d4:45=But I can't look at you as a love interest at the same time.

uid010c1422.msg:0039:0x00009A39:0310:50=Hehehe, I'm so glad. See, there's that kindness of yours.
uid010c1422.msg:0056:0x00009A73:031c:51=Now I have to go help with the purification rites, so I'll see you back at the shrine!

uid010c1422.msg:004b:0x00009B2A:0364:55=Saito-san! I... certainly didn't expect to see you here. What are the odds?

uid010c1444.msg:0076:0x0000A7E7:03ac:58=Hmm. A tangle of friendship and romance... Men who commit suicide due to the pain of losing the people they cherish...
uid010c1444.msg:0044:0x0000A85E:03b8:59=It's a story about relationships and emotions. You should call it...

uid010c1444.msg:001f:0x0000A8AA:03d0:61=Heart? It's simple... poetic...

uid010c1444.msg:0084:0x0000A9B3:0400:65=Nothing scintillates my creativity like a good title! This will be my magnum opus! I'll earn the reprieve from death you granted me!

uid010c1444.msg:002b:0x0000AA42:0418:67=Eh, cleavage!? I'm sorry, what do you mean?
uid010c1444.msg:007f:0x0000AA6E:0424:68=The mentor and Kei are cleft apart because they love the same woman. So are the mentor and the main character, after his death.
uid010c1444.msg:0032:0x0000AAEE:0430:69=Oh, so you mean for me to title the book Cleavage?
uid010c1444.msg:0050:0x0000AB21:043c:70=It's a bit lewd, isn't it? I'd like to think this work has some greater meaning.

uid010c1444.msg:0047:0x0000AB81:0454:72=Hmm. I'm afraid calling my novel Cleavage would risk misleading people.
uid010c1444.msg:000b:0x0000ABC9:0460:73=Then again!

uid010c1444.msg:0073:0x0000AD54:04b4:80=To be honest with you, I think your best work was still the animal book. I was pretty bored hearing about this one.
uid010c1444.msg:0038:0x0000ADC8:04c0:81=Oh. I see. So, I should write a book called Animal Barn?
uid010c1444.msg:0079:0x0000AE01:04cc:82=Hmm. What about a story set on a homestead where many animals dwell, perhaps each kind functioning as a type of allegory?
uid010c1444.msg:0006:0x0000AE7B:04d8:83=Maybe.
uid010c1444.msg:007d:0x0000AE82:04e4:84=However, in a narrative entirely about the doings of animals, readers might be curious about the whereabouts of the humans...

uid010c1444.msg:004f:0x0000B11E:0598:93=Nonsense. Without you, I never would have been able to finish my novel on time.

uid010c1444.msg:002c:0x0000B21E:05d4:97=The reception for I Am But a Cat has been...
uid010c1444.msg:005a:0x0000B24B:05e0:98=Astonishingly good! People love the idea of setting a novel from the perspective of a cat!
uid010c1444.msg:000d:0x0000B2A6:05ec:99=That's great.

uid010c1444.msg:0023:0x0000B734:070c:121=What kind of story is it this time?
uid010c1444.msg:0058:0x0000B758:0718:122=Well, the main character is a schoolteacher, though he's a brash and reckless young man.
uid010c1444.msg:0079:0x0000B7B1:0724:123=And he, in his tenure, finds himself ensnared in a battle of wit and will by the strong personalities which surround him.
uid010c1444.msg:0083:0x0000B82B:0730:124=He falls prey again and again to adversity, either through happenstance or as consequence of his own intractable sense of morality.
uid010c1444.msg:008b:0x0000B8AF:073c:125=Ultimately, he resigns and finds a more peaceful life elsewhere—having at last outgrown his childish predilection for errors and botches.
uid010c1444.msg:002f:0x0000B93B:0748:126=Sounds interesting. What aren't you sure about?
uid010c1444.msg:001c:0x0000B96B:0754:127=Well... he needs a nickname.
uid010c1444.msg:000e:0x0000B988:0760:128=Eh? That's it?
uid010c1444.msg:007f:0x0000B997:076c:129=That's it, yes. I plan for the entire cast of characters to be known by sobriquets—their real names eschewed by the narrator.
uid010c1444.msg:0070:0x0000BA17:0778:130=Our protagonist should be called something familiar and evocative, and that will serve too as the novel's title.
uid010c1444.msg:0033:0x0000BA88:0784:131=Hmm. The protagonist's nickname and also the title?
uid010c1444.msg:000c:0x0000BABC:0790:132=Yes, indeed.
uid010c1444.msg:0037:0x0000BAC9:079c:133=What about calling him the Great Gallivanting Disaster?
uid010c1444.msg:0069:0x0000BB01:07a8:134=Great... Gallivanting...? It's true, I've mostly characterized him as a tragic plaything of misfortune...
uid010c1444.msg:006d:0x0000BB6B:07b4:135=It's somewhat loquacious, though... Unless— Now, hold on! What if the disasters themselves became my focus?
uid010c1444.msg:005a:0x0000BBD9:07c0:136=And what's more—what if these gallivanting disasters took on a certain... erotic nature?
uid010c1444.msg:0024:0x0000BC34:07cc:137=Um, I wasn't necessarily thinking—
uid010c1444.msg:0027:0x0000BC59:07d8:138=Erotic disasters... Erotic disasters...

uid010c1444.msg:007d:0x0000BD76:0814:143=Botch-chan, you say? It's true, much of his misfortune is due to his own principles and the roughshod ways he applies them...
uid010c1444.msg:0085:0x0000BDF4:0820:144=And since the novel follows him from boyhood, something that reminds the reader of his youth throughout his journey is quite fitting!
uid010c1444.msg:003a:0x0000BE7A:082c:145=Botch-chan is a splendid title! I'm rife with inspiration!
uid010c1444.msg:0017:0x0000BEB5:0838:146=Heh, glad I could help.

uid010c1444.msg:0079:0x0000BF6E:085c:149=Eh, an animal? Like my last story? It's true, the device did resonate with readers. Dare I return once more to that well?
uid010c1444.msg:0079:0x0000BFE8:0868:150=Unless... Now, hold on! What if, by being a four-legged creature, he could survey the humans at their most candid angles?

uid010c1444.msg:0012:0x0000C11A:08a4:155=I'm happy for you.
uid010c1444.msg:007c:0x0000C12D:08b0:156=This is going to be ten times the novel that I'm a Something-or-Other was! Let's get writing before death claims me at last!
uid010c1444.msg:0043:0x0000C1AC:08d4:157=Heh. All right. Work hard and... give the death thing a rest, yeah?
uid010c1444.msg:004a:0x0000C1F4:0910:158=Ugh! It's all over for me! There's nothing more to do but accept my death!
uid010c1444.msg:002c:0x0000C23F:091c:159=Hey, get ahold of yourself! What's going on?
uid010c1444.msg:0016:0x0000C26C:0928:160=Eh? Wh—Who are you!?
uid010c1444.msg:0045:0x0000C283:0934:161=I'm another guest of this inn. I heard you shouting through the wall.
uid010c1444.msg:0052:0x0000C2C9:0940:162=Was I so loud!? Agh, forgive me, sir! Please, accept my gruesome death as penance!
uid010c1444.msg:0046:0x0000C31C:094c:163=I'd rather not. Can I ask you what's happened? You seem pretty fed up.
uid010c1444.msg:002c:0x0000C363:0958:164=Well, in truth, I'm trying to write a story.
uid010c1444.msg:000a:0x0000C390:0964:165=That's it?
uid010c1444.msg:006a:0x0000C39B:0970:166=Pardon me, my good man. I should have introduced myself earlier. My name is Natsumi Sosaku. I'm an author.
uid010c1444.msg:0028:0x0000C406:097c:167=Really? I've never met an author before.
uid010c1444.msg:006c:0x0000C42F:0988:168=Sadly, it's no great feat. Particularly as my nib pen has run utterly dry of inspiration's ink, so to speak.
uid010c1444.msg:006a:0x0000C49D:09a0:169=Woe! The deadline for my novel fast approaches and I've yet to even decide on the story's very foundation!
uid010c1444.msg:006d:0x0000C50B:09d0:170=I submit! Death is my sole recourse! Please, send my apologies along with my obituary to the printing office!
uid010c1444.msg:0047:0x0000C57A:09e8:171=So, that's why you were making all this noise? You have writer's block?
uid010c1444.msg:0051:0x0000C5C2:09f4:172=Ugh. Never mind. Perhaps instead you would be so kind as to offer me some advice?
uid010c1444.msg:0028:0x0000C614:0a00:173=Me? What good would my advice be to you?
uid010c1444.msg:0076:0x0000C63D:0a0c:174=Well, if nothing else, you are a fellow guest of the esteemed Teradaya. That makes us colleagues of a sort. Mister...?
uid010c1444.msg:002b:0x0000C6B4:0a18:175=Saito. Sorry, but I'm not really well-read.
uid010c1444.msg:005d:0x0000C6E0:0a24:176=Please. I would sooner breathe my last than rely solely on the so-called wisdom of academics.
uid010c1444.msg:0053:0x0000C73E:0a30:177=What I need comes not from the mind, but the soul. I seek inspiration for my story.
uid010c1444.msg:0011:0x0000C792:0a3c:178=Inspiration, huh?
uid010c1444.msg:0055:0x0000C7A4:0a48:179=For you see, I've a vague concept—but the words which might give it shape elude me.
uid010c1444.msg:0011:0x0000C7FA:0a54:180=What's your idea?
uid010c1444.msg:0050:0x0000C80C:0a60:181=Well... I envision a fanciful tale told from the perspective of a humble animal.
uid010c1444.msg:0030:0x0000C85D:0a6c:182=All right. So, an animal is your main character?
uid010c1444.msg:0070:0x0000C88E:0a78:183=Exactly, my good man! I thought, perhaps this creature could observe our daily human activities with keen humor.
uid010c1444.msg:0050:0x0000C8FF:0a84:184=However, I am at a loss as to what manner of beast would best suit this purpose.
uid010c1444.msg:0037:0x0000C950:0a90:185=I imagine this title... I Am But a... <i>Something</i>.
uid010c1444.msg:0049:0x0000C988:0a9c:186=Hm, and you need to decide what kind of animal the protagonist should be.
uid010c1444.msg:0056:0x0000C9D2:0aa8:187=Yes! One haughty in its own mind, yet lowly in human estimation! Have you any insight?
uid010c1444.msg:000f:0x0000CA29:0ab4:188=Cats are funny!
uid010c1444.msg:0028:0x0000CA39:0ac0:189=A cat? Yes, I find them amusing as well!
uid010c1444.msg:0056:0x0000CA62:0acc:190=Cats are not unlike humans, yet the ways in which they differ from us can be profound!
uid010c1444.msg:001f:0x0000CAB9:0ad8:191=I Am But a Cat... It's perfect!
uid010c1444.msg:0017:0x0000CAD9:0ae4:192=Heh, glad I could help.
uid010c1444.msg:0055:0x0000CAF1:0af0:193=All that is left to do is put pen to paper! I believe the words will come easily now!
uid010c1444.msg:0021:0x0000CB47:0afc:194=An underdog that's an actual dog!
uid010c1444.msg:0061:0x0000CB69:0b08:195=An underdog? One whose foul fortunes have branded them a wastrel in the eyes of society, perhaps?
uid010c1444.msg:0040:0x0000CBCB:0b14:196=The title would be... I Am But a Dog. How melancholy. And yet...
uid010c1444.msg:0009:0x0000CC0C:0b20:197=Um, sure.
uid010c1444.msg:0054:0x0000CC16:0b2c:198=I sense a feverish bout of inspiration approaching! I must put pen to paper at once!
uid010c1444.msg:0061:0x0000CC6B:0b38:199=My story's theme may be slightly avant-garde, but I will write as though my life depends upon it!
uid010c1444.msg:001d:0x0000CCCD:0b44:200=Nothing's lowlier than swine!
uid010c1444.msg:003e:0x0000CCEB:0b50:201=Swine? You mean to say, a pig? I see... I Am But a Pig? Hmm...
uid010c1444.msg:008d:0x0000CD2A:0b5c:202=I must confess... there's a certain erotic connotation to such a title. Obsequious gentlemen are wont to brand themselves pigs, are they not?
uid010c1444.msg:0009:0x0000CDB8:0b68:203=Um, sure.
uid010c1444.msg:0054:0x0000CDC2:0b74:204=I sense a feverish bout of inspiration approaching! I must put pen to paper at once!
uid010c1444.msg:0061:0x0000CE17:0b80:205=My story's theme may be slightly avant-garde, but I will write as though my life depends upon it!
uid010c1444.msg:0043:0x0000CE79:0b8c:206=Heh. All right. Work hard and... try not to keep begging for death.
uid010c1445.msg:0050:0x00001308:0098:1=(It's that author's room, Natsumi. I wonder if he was able to finish his story.)

uid010c144f.msg:0037:0x00006E4F:0078:4=I don't know how to thank you. What are you doing here?
uid010c144f.msg:0071:0x00006E87:0084:5=You and the other man were both carrying similar packages. When we all bumped into each other, they got switched.
uid010c144f.msg:003c:0x00006EF9:0090:6=Oh, I see! So, that's how a gun became a flavorful fishcake.
uid010c144f.msg:001f:0x00006F36:009c:7=My name is Saiki. I'm a trader.
uid010c144f.msg:000b:0x00006F56:00a8:8=A trader...
uid010c144f.msg:0074:0x00006F62:00b4:9=Right. Those men were extorting me. They kidnapped my daughter so that I had no choice but to smuggle arms for them.
uid010c144f.msg:006b:0x00006FD8:00cc:10=Because of you, though, those criminals won't get their hands on any guns. You've done a lot of good today!
uid010c144f.msg:0062:0x00007044:00d8:11=There's still one thing left to do. I need to see both packages returned to their rightful owners.
uid010c144f.msg:0021:0x000070A8:00f0:12=You returned the swapped package.
uid010c144f.msg:000a:0x000070CA:00fc:13=Of course.
uid010c144f.msg:0041:0x000070D5:0108:14=Here's the one you gave me originally. Return it with my regards.
uid010c144f.msg:0022:0x00007117:0114:15=You retrieved the swapped package.
uid010c144f.msg:001e:0x0000713A:0120:16=Thank you, samurai-san. Oyuki?
uid010c144f.msg:0020:0x00007159:012c:17=Thank you for saving me, mister.
uid010c144f.msg:001b:0x0000717A:0138:18=I'm glad things worked out.
uid010c144f.msg:0035:0x00007198:015c:19=(All right. Now to bring this back where it belongs.)
uid010c144f.msg:007a:0x000071CF:0174:20=(I'm surprised. After all his talk about how important the package was to him, it was just some chikuwa. Seems excessive.)
uid010c144f.msg:0023:0x00007251:018c:21=(Hm... It does look pretty good...)
uid010c144f.msg:0041:0x00007275:0198:22=(This chikuwa means a lot to him. I shouldn't deprive him of it.)

uid010c144f.msg:0039:0x000072E3:01b0:24=(Damn. That's pretty good. Better than I'd have thought.)
uid010c144f.msg:001a:0x0000731E:01c8:25=You gained 200 experience.
uid010c144f.msg:001e:0x00007339:01d4:26=(Hm. Four chikuwa left now...)
uid010c144f.msg:001a:0x00007358:01e0:27=(What's one more chikuwa?)
uid010c144f.msg:006d:0x00007373:01ec:28=(It actually tastes better the second time. I think I can understand now why he said these were so precious.)
uid010c144f.msg:001a:0x000073E2:0204:29=You gained 200 experience.
uid010c144f.msg:0017:0x000073FD:0210:30=(Three chikuwa left...)
uid010c144f.msg:001a:0x00007415:021c:31=(What's one more chikuwa?)
uid010c144f.msg:0035:0x00007430:0228:32=(They're addictive! I don't think I can stop myself.)
uid010c144f.msg:001a:0x00007467:0240:33=You gained 200 experience.
uid010c144f.msg:0015:0x00007482:024c:34=(Two chikuwa left...)
uid010c144f.msg:002a:0x00007498:0258:35=(All right. I can at least leave him one.)
uid010c144f.msg:000c:0x000074C3:0264:36=(Delicious!)
uid010c144f.msg:001a:0x000074D1:027c:37=You gained 200 experience.
uid010c144f.msg:001a:0x000074EC:0288:38=(Only one chikuwa left...)
uid010c144f.msg:002d:0x00007507:0294:39=(I'm eating every one of these damn chikuwa.)
uid010c144f.msg:0015:0x00007535:02a0:40=(It's just too good!)
uid010c144f.msg:001a:0x0000754C:02b8:41=You gained 200 experience.
uid010c144f.msg:002e:0x00007567:02c4:42=(I think... I might've gotten carried away...)
uid010c144f.msg:0040:0x00007596:02d0:43=(Well, I took some for myself, but I should give the rest back.)
uid010c144f.msg:0005:0x000075D8:02e8:44=(Hm?)
uid010c144f.msg:0021:0x000075DE:02f4:45=You're late. Have you brought it?

uid010c144f.msg:004f:0x00007610:030c:47=(That's him, the man whose package I accidentally swapped with someone else's.)
uid010c144f.msg:004d:0x00007660:0318:48=Heheheh, the latest in small arms, huh? Demand's gonna be high for this baby.
uid010c144f.msg:003c:0x000076AE:0324:49=Eh? Why's the bundle look so scuffed? Are the goods damaged?
uid010c144f.msg:0020:0x000076EB:0330:50=N-No, of course not, I... Oh no.
uid010c144f.msg:0021:0x0000770C:033c:51=Oi, oi! What's this "oh no" shit?
uid010c144f.msg:003c:0x0000772E:0348:52=Um... Well, the merchandise might have taken a tiny spill...
uid010c144f.msg:0045:0x0000776B:0354:53=Damn it! I told you to be careful, didn't I!? Let's get a look at it.
uid010c144f.msg:0034:0x000077B1:0360:54=Forgive me! I'm sure it's all right on the inside...
uid010c144f.msg:0011:0x000077E6:036c:55=Hm... Seems okay.
uid010c144f.msg:0013:0x000077F8:0378:56=Oh! Thank goodness.
uid010c144f.msg:0046:0x0000780C:0384:57=Like you'd expect of cutting edge technology, huh? Not even a scratch!
uid010c144f.msg:005e:0x00007853:0390:58=And talk about innovation—It's soft, grippable, and fits perfectly in the palm of your hand!
uid010c144f.msg:0056:0x000078B2:039c:59=Why, and if you get hungry while using it, you can just help yourself to a tasty bite!
uid010c144f.msg:0040:0x00007909:03a8:60=Heheheh! With a weapon like this, no one could stand against me!
uid010c144f.msg:0022:0x0000794A:03b4:61=You <i>idiot</i>! This is chikuwa!
uid010c144f.msg:006a:0x0000796D:03c0:62=Huh!? It couldn't be! But... that smell. Fish paste, egg, cooked on a bamboo stalk!? It <i>is</i> chikuwa!

uid010c144f.msg:0043:0x00007E87:05c4:93=Sorry about that. My sandal string... um, never mind. Are you hurt?
uid010c144f.msg:0038:0x00007ECB:05d0:94=Yeah, actually, really badly. I'll be all right, though.
uid010c144f.msg:0057:0x00007F04:05dc:95=Just be more careful from now on, would you? I gotta go— Shit, I dropped the package!

uid010c144f.msg:0026:0x000082A0:0774:119=I think I know what might've happened.
uid010c144f.msg:0017:0x000082C7:0780:120=Eh? You do!? Pray tell!
uid010c144f.msg:0059:0x000082DF:078c:121=Well, the other man that ran into me, he was carrying a package that looked like yours...
uid010c144f.msg:003d:0x00008339:0798:122=Eh? Eh!? So, in all the confusion, our packages got switched?
uid010c144f.msg:000b:0x00008377:07a4:123=I think so.
uid010c144f.msg:0036:0x00008383:07b0:124=Well, la dee <i>da</i>! What am I supposed to do now!?
uid010c144f.msg:0049:0x000083BA:07bc:125=My wonderful package is out there in the hands of some gun-toting maniac!
uid010c144f.msg:0040:0x00008404:07c8:126=That package holds something stupendous... What am I ever to do?
uid010c144f.msg:0047:0x00008445:07d4:127=(Hm. I admit, I'm curious why that other man was carrying a firearm...)
uid010c144f.msg:0048:0x0000848D:07e0:128=He mentioned he was going to Mukurogai. Maybe you could catch up to him.
uid010c144f.msg:0064:0x000084D6:07ec:129=Mukurogai? The Dead Man's Quarter? Skeleton Avenue? Bone Boulevard!? You want me to go <i>there</i>?
uid010c144f.msg:0062:0x0000853B:07f8:130=Fine. This was my fault in the first place, I'll track him down for you and get your package back.
uid010c144f.msg:002e:0x0000859E:0804:131=You will!? Oh, thank you—you're a lifesaver!
uid010c144f.msg:0029:0x000085CD:0810:132=I'll take that to him, if you don't mind.
uid010c144f.msg:0050:0x000085F7:081c:133=The six-gun? Of course. You might need it for protection, heading down that way.
uid010c144f.msg:0021:0x00008649:0834:134=You received the swapped package.
uid010c144f.msg:0050:0x0000866B:0840:135=The contents of my package are truly precious. You must return it to me, please!
uid010c144f.msg:000d:0x000086BC:084c:136=I understand.
uid010c144f.msg:005e:0x000086CA:0858:137=(The other man had a gun bundled up in a parcel. Could he have been delivering it to someone?)

uid010c1457.msg:0057:0x00001767:0068:4=What happened? You were so desperate to try it for yourself that you resorted to theft?
uid010c1457.msg:0036:0x000017BF:0074:5=It's not that! I swear, I had a reason for what I did.
uid010c1457.msg:000c:0x000017F6:0080:6=What reason?
uid010c1457.msg:0073:0x00001803:008c:7=It's my son. He's sick—too sick to even leave his bed. He has no more appetite. He hasn't eaten anything in days!
uid010c1457.msg:0048:0x00001877:0098:8=But this morning, he looked me in the eye and said that he wanted inari!
uid010c1457.msg:0051:0x000018C0:00a4:9=He's only ever had it once before, but still—I guess he never forgot the taste.
uid010c1457.msg:0065:0x00001912:00b0:10=I ran as fast as I could to queue up for one, but it sold out right as I got to the head of the line!
uid010c1457.msg:002a:0x00001978:00bc:11=Mm. So, that's why you tried to grab mine?
uid010c1457.msg:005f:0x000019A3:00c8:12=I'm sorry. I know it was wrong. If you want to hand me over to the authorities, I won't resist.
uid010c1457.msg:000e:0x00001A0A:00e0:13=Here. Take it.
uid010c1457.msg:0004:0x00001A19:00ec:14=Huh?
uid010c1457.msg:0035:0x00001A1E:00f8:15=Your son is hungry, isn't he? Don't keep him waiting.
uid010c1457.msg:000b:0x00001A54:0104:16=But, sir...
uid010c1457.msg:0054:0x00001A60:0110:17=There's a sick child out there, hoping his father will come home with inari for him.
uid010c1457.msg:003b:0x00001AB5:011c:18=Are you sure? You must have wanted it badly for yourself...
uid010c1457.msg:0046:0x00001AF1:0128:19=(That's true, but in this case, I don't mind lining up one more time.)
uid010c1457.msg:001c:0x00001B38:0134:20=Don't worry. It's all right.
uid010c1457.msg:005c:0x00001B55:0140:21=I... I don't know how to thank you! This was the last chance my son had to ever taste inari!
uid010c1457.msg:0015:0x00001BB2:014c:22=Hm? What do you mean?
uid010c1457.msg:0066:0x00001BC8:0158:23=Haven't you heard? That vendor's moving on tomorrow. The whole inari shop's headed to some other city.
uid010c1457.msg:001e:0x00001C2F:0164:24=That's why it had to be today!
uid010c1457.msg:000c:0x00001C4E:0170:25=Wait, what!?
uid010c1457.msg:004d:0x00001C5B:017c:26=This is the last of its kind! Truly precious! Sir, thank you again! Farewell!

uid010c147a.msg:007a:0x0000338F:0208:23=Tell you what—just to put the whole thing behind us, it's yours for free. Honestly, I don't even know how well it works.
uid010c147a.msg:006c:0x0000340A:0214:24=You don't? I suppose it is hard to believe that some little bottle of water will make you attractive to men.
uid010c147a.msg:0041:0x00003477:0220:25=You can try it out first, if you're skeptical. Here, have a waft.
uid010c147a.msg:006b:0x000034BA:0238:26=Oh! Hm. There <i>is</i> an aroma to it... It's sensual. Still, it's nothing like a love potion, to be sure.
uid010c147a.msg:0033:0x00003528:025c:27=I told someone I'd get it for them, though. Thanks.

uid010c1498.msg:0041:0x00003ACB:0114:11=Don't be sorry, this is to be expected when someone loses family.
uid010c1498.msg:0037:0x00003B0D:0120:12=Yes... Especially since now they've killed him twice...
uid010c1498.msg:0009:0x00003B45:012c:13=Twice...?
uid010c1498.msg:0086:0x00003B4F:0138:14=Yes. See, we had a son named Kazukichi. He was such a kind boy. Not the brightest, but he had a huge heart. And that's more important.
uid010c1498.msg:0054:0x00003BD6:0144:15=I remember when the three of us lived in Edo. My wife talked a lot more back then...
uid010c1498.msg:0078:0x00003C32:015c:16=But ever since our son was slain right in front of us... I just don't know if she's ever truly recovered from the grief.
uid010c1498.msg:004d:0x00003CB2:0174:17=See, one day our son happened to offend a joshi. He always was a naive boy...
uid010c1498.msg:0054:0x00003D00:0180:18=And ever since he passed away, my wife hasn't been able to talk about anything else.

uid010c1498.msg:0087:0x00003D6A:0198:20=We were devastated. And we got this dog, thinking it would fill the void in our hearts, even just a little. We named him after our son.
uid010c1498.msg:002c:0x00003DF2:01a4:21=Ah, so that's why the dog has the same name.
uid010c1498.msg:0088:0x00003E1F:01b0:22=Yes. There was so much about him that reminded us of our son... His friendly eyes, his affectionate nature... he even had the same yawn.
uid010c1498.msg:0049:0x00003EA8:01bc:23=We cared for that pup like he was our dead son. We loved him so, so much.
uid010c1498.msg:002b:0x00003EF2:01c8:24=And now... this. It's... almost too much...
uid010c1498.msg:0006:0x00003F1E:01d4:25=Sir...
uid010c1498.msg:0085:0x00003F25:01e0:26=The whole reason we moved here was I thought some fresh scenery could help heal my wife's heart. I never thought this would happen...

uid010c1498.msg:0011:0x00003FF0:01f8:28=My name is Saito.

uid010c1498.msg:0072:0x000040D6:0240:32=Your loyal dog deserves most of the credit. He held them off until I made it here. Let's give thanks to Kazukichi.
uid010c1498.msg:003b:0x00004149:024c:33=...You're right. He was such a good boy. Just like our son.
uid010c1498.msg:0020:0x00004185:0258:34=Give him the burial he deserves.
uid010c1498.msg:0027:0x000041A6:0264:35=We will cremate him and bury his bones.
uid010c1498.msg:005b:0x000041CE:0270:36=The only question is where... We only just moved here so we don't know the lay of the land.

uid010c1498.msg:0011:0x00004271:02c4:39=Oh. I understand.
uid010c1498.msg:0066:0x00004288:02dc:40=Kazukichi loved cherry blossoms. When they were in season, he would run from tree to tree, so happy...

uid010c14a2.msg:0059:0x00002AFA:0198:21=Maybe it's his way of saying thank you to the both of you. That's what I think, at least.

uid010c14a2.msg:0058:0x00002C21:0240:28=Yes. It's been here for a long time, actually. But it doesn't flower anymore. It's dead.
uid010c14a2.msg:000b:0x00002C7A:024c:29=Oh. Really?
uid010c14a2.msg:0061:0x00002C86:0258:30=Uh-huh. It used to flower when I was little, but I haven't seen a single blossom on it for years.
uid010c14a2.msg:0018:0x00002CE8:0264:31=I see. That's a shame...
uid010c14a2.msg:0035:0x00002D01:0270:32=Why? Are you interested in gardening all of a sudden?
uid010c14a2.msg:004a:0x00002D37:027c:33=No... It's just there's this old man who's been looking for a cherry tree.
uid010c14a2.msg:0020:0x00002D82:0288:34=What? Why is he looking for one?
uid010c14a2.msg:0047:0x00002DA7:02c4:35=...So now he and his wife want to bury their dog beneath a cherry tree.
uid010c14a2.msg:0052:0x00002DEF:02d0:36=That's so sad. What a horrible story, they've lost both their son and their dog...
uid010c14a2.msg:0035:0x00002E42:02dc:37=Yeah. That's why I wanted to do something for them...
uid010c14a2.msg:003b:0x00002E78:02e8:38=Hmm... Well, do you think the one in the garden would work?
uid010c14a2.msg:0016:0x00002EB4:02f4:39=The one in the garden?
uid010c14a2.msg:0084:0x00002ECB:0300:40=Yeah. I know it's dead, but I just don't think you're going to find another one where you'll be allowed to bury bones. Use this one.
uid010c14a2.msg:0033:0x00002F50:030c:41=But are you fine with the bones being here, Haruka?
uid010c14a2.msg:002a:0x00002F84:0318:42=Of course. If it will help the old couple.
uid010c14a2.msg:0037:0x00002FAF:0324:43=All right. I'll go ask the old man. You're a kind girl.
uid010c14a2.msg:000b:0x00002FE7:0330:44=Aw. Thanks.

uid010c14af.msg:0010:0x000015EA:007c:3=Huh? What is it?
uid010c14af.msg:0019:0x000015FB:0088:4=Feel like having a drink?
uid010c14af.msg:0009:0x00001615:0094:5=With you?
uid010c14af.msg:008c:0x0000161F:00a0:6=Well, of course! I've come a long way to be here in Kyo, only to find myself drinking alone. Can ya help an old man look less pathetic, son?
uid010c14af.msg:0050:0x000016AC:00ac:7=I don't like turning you down, but there's someone I'm supposed to meet. Wait...
uid010c14af.msg:0034:0x000016FD:00b8:8=Did you just say you've come a long way? Are you...?
uid010c14af.msg:0004:0x00001732:00c4:9=Hmm?
uid010c14af.msg:002f:0x0000173A:00f4:10=Ahhhh, methinks the okami sent you here for me!
uid010c14af.msg:0033:0x0000176A:0100:11=Women in Kyo are so thoughtful. Color me impressed.
uid010c14af.msg:004c:0x0000179E:010c:12=Heh, I'll admit, I didn't expect you to be the Kanda-sensei I'm looking for.
uid010c14af.msg:0083:0x000017EB:0118:13=Please, call me Kanda! No need for all that "sensei" business... Though, if you insist, I'll certainly take the compliment! Hahaha!
uid010c14af.msg:0064:0x0000186F:0124:14=(Huh. I thought he'd be more intimidating, being famous and all. But he's actually pretty friendly.)
uid010c14af.msg:004d:0x000018D4:0130:15=So what sort of artist are you, Kanda? I know there are many different kinds.
uid010c14af.msg:0055:0x00001922:013c:16=Oh? You're unfamiliar with my oeuvre? Why, I take part in every form of art there is!
uid010c14af.msg:0007:0x00001978:0148:17=Really?
uid010c14af.msg:006b:0x00001980:0154:18=Painting, pottery, theater, music, song, and dance... By the time I hit thirty, I was a master of them all!
uid010c14af.msg:0012:0x000019EC:0160:19=That's impressive.
uid010c14af.msg:001d:0x000019FF:016c:20=It is, if I do say so myself!
uid010c14af.msg:0032:0x00001A1D:0178:21=(This old-timer must really be something special.)
uid010c14af.msg:003e:0x00001A50:0184:22=Hey—you know what? There's a singing bar right here in town.
uid010c14af.msg:000e:0x00001A8F:0190:23=Ah, I've been.
uid010c14af.msg:0053:0x00001A9E:019c:24=Really? Why didn't you say so!? Let's get right over there—I wanna hear you sing!
uid010c14af.msg:000e:0x00001AF2:01a8:25=Me!? What for?
uid010c14af.msg:0022:0x00001B01:01b4:26=Hush, before you change your mind!
uid010c14af.msg:001a:0x00001B24:01c0:27=Waitress! Bring the check!
uid010c14af.msg:000d:0x00001B3F:01cc:28=Seriously...?
uid010c14b2.msg:0028:0x00003188:0038:1=Whew. All right, old man. You happy now?
uid010c14b2.msg:0008:0x000031B1:0044:2=Saito...
uid010c14b2.msg:0059:0x000031BB:005c:3=I am so incredibly, marvelously, deeply moved! Your voice is as smooth as a polished gem!
uid010c14b2.msg:0010:0x00003215:0068:4=Are you serious?
uid010c14b2.msg:0056:0x00003226:0074:5=As a heart attack! Which you almost made me have, by the way, 'cause you were so good!
uid010c14b2.msg:004b:0x0000327D:0080:6=(The man's got a way with words. Can't tell who's entertaining who here...)
uid010c14b2.msg:002b:0x000032C9:008c:7=Another song! Serenade us some more, Saito!
uid010c14b2.msg:001d:0x000032F5:0098:8=You want to hear another one?
uid010c14b2.msg:0032:0x00003313:00a4:9=Of course. Who wouldn't want to hear such euphony?
uid010c14b2.msg:0016:0x00003346:00b0:10=Well, if you insist...
uid010c14b2.msg:0039:0x0000335D:00bc:11=Well, that sure was something... Something hideous, haha!
uid010c14b2.msg:0018:0x00003397:00c8:12=Sorry to disappoint you.
uid010c14b2.msg:006d:0x000033B0:00d4:13=Aw, well you know, being an <i>artiste</i> isn't about technique anyway. It's about heart! So don't sweat it.
uid010c14b2.msg:004e:0x0000341E:00e0:14=(The man sure has a way with words... Can't tell who's entertaining who here.)
uid010c14b2.msg:0034:0x0000346D:00ec:15=Next song! Get ready to belt another one out, Saito!
uid010c14b2.msg:0024:0x000034A2:00f8:16=What? You want me to sing some more?
uid010c14b2.msg:0076:0x000034C7:0104:17=Of course. Technique isn't everything in art, but it still goes pretty darn far. That's why I've decided to coach you!
uid010c14b2.msg:0006:0x0000353E:0110:18=Ngh...
uid010c14b2.msg:0026:0x00003549:014c:19=Whew... That's about all I can sing...
uid010c14b2.msg:0040:0x00003570:0158:20=Come on, Saito! You tired already? Toughen up those vocal cords!
uid010c14b2.msg:0023:0x000035B1:0164:21=No, I think I'm at my limit here...
uid010c14b2.msg:0013:0x000035D5:0170:22=Ah, very well then.
uid010c14b2.msg:0015:0x000035E9:017c:23=Oh... By the gods...!
uid010c14b2.msg:000f:0x000035FF:0188:24=A-Are you okay?
uid010c14b2.msg:0058:0x0000360F:0194:25=I've been struck with a bolt of heavenly inspiration, just from listening to your voice!
uid010c14b2.msg:0021:0x00003668:01a0:26=Are you serious? <i>My</i> voice?
uid010c14b2.msg:0073:0x0000368A:01ac:27=Oh yes... I feel it! The very essence of truth and beauty is surging through me! Bring me a brush and paper. Hurry!
uid010c14b2.msg:004b:0x000036FE:01b8:28=Okay. If it's the <i>essence of truth and beauty</i> we're talking about...
uid010c14b2.msg:000e:0x00003754:023c:29=Whew... There.
uid010c14b2.msg:003f:0x00003763:0248:30=(He drew that in one go. That took some serious concentration.)
uid010c14b2.msg:003e:0x000037A3:0254:31=(I forgot who this guy really is—a true master of the arts.)
uid010c14b2.msg:004a:0x000037E2:0260:32=Behold! My interpretation of the symphony which emanated from your throat!
uid010c14b2.msg:0011:0x0000382D:026c:33=(Wow, this is...)
uid010c14b2.msg:0014:0x0000383F:0278:34=(...I have no idea!)
uid010c14b2.msg:004e:0x00003854:0284:35=What do you think, Saito? Don't you think it shows how striking your voice is?
uid010c14b2.msg:0018:0x000038A3:0290:36=Yeah! It... sure does...
uid010c14b2.msg:0036:0x000038BC:029c:37=Aha, so you understand me. What about it spoke to you?
uid010c14b2.msg:0033:0x000038F3:02a8:38=Those delicate lines of color are really something.
uid010c14b2.msg:0023:0x00003927:02b4:39=Really? You think they're delicate?
uid010c14b2.msg:002e:0x0000394B:02c0:40=Hrm... That wasn't my intent in the slightest.
uid010c14b2.msg:002b:0x0000397A:02cc:41=(Oof. Guess I missed the mark on that one.)
uid010c14b2.msg:0047:0x000039A6:02d8:42=It seems you don't really have an eye for art after all... What a pity.
uid010c14b2.msg:0017:0x000039EE:02e4:43=Yeah, sorry... I guess.
uid010c14b2.msg:003f:0x00003A06:02f0:44=The strokes are bold and virile. They almost leap off the page.
uid010c14b2.msg:001b:0x00003A46:02fc:45=Bold and virile, you say...
uid010c14b2.msg:0054:0x00003A62:0308:46=Fantastic! That's exactly what I was going for! Wow, I'm even better than I thought!
uid010c14b2.msg:0024:0x00003AB7:0314:47=(Seems like I said the right thing.)
uid010c14b2.msg:0040:0x00003ADC:0320:48=You have quite the keen eye for art, Saito. Rare thing nowadays.
uid010c14b2.msg:0012:0x00003B1D:032c:49=Heh, you think so?
uid010c14b2.msg:0043:0x00003B30:0338:50=I can't really explain why, but I know the drawing's a masterpiece.
uid010c14b2.msg:0070:0x00003B7B:0350:51=Hahaha! So something's made an impression on you, but you can't put your finger on what. At least you're honest!
uid010c14b2.msg:001e:0x00003BEC:035c:52=(That seemed to go over okay.)
uid010c14b2.msg:005e:0x00003C0B:0368:53=That's about what I expected from you, Saito. I understand my work can be a bit, uh, highbrow.
uid010c14b2.msg:0014:0x00003C6A:0374:54=Sure, if you say so.
uid010c14b2.msg:0042:0x00003C7F:0380:55=By the way, do you have any other artistic skills besides singing?
uid010c14b2.msg:002a:0x00003CC2:038c:56=Well. There is one other thing I can do...
uid010c14b2.msg:0005:0x00003CED:0398:57=Buyo.
uid010c14b2.msg:002c:0x00003CF3:03a4:58=What! You can dance!? Why didn't you say so!
uid010c14b2.msg:0052:0x00003D20:03b0:59=It seems you have some inner elegance about you! Let's see some of that right now!
uid010c14b2.msg:0026:0x00003D73:03bc:60=Does it have to be right this instant?
uid010c14b2.msg:0033:0x00003D9A:03c8:61=But of course! We must seize the moment! Follow me!
uid010c14b2.msg:002e:0x00003DD7:03f8:62=I expect a good show, Saito! Don't disappoint!
uid010c14b2.msg:0008:0x00003E06:0404:63=Right...
uid010c14b2.msg:006b:0x00003E0F:0410:64=(Never thought I'd wind up performing in front of a big artist... Guess I'll have to give it all I've got.)
uid010c14b4.msg:000d:0x00002EE8:0038:1=...Satisfied?
uid010c14b4.msg:0008:0x00002EF6:0044:2=Saito...
uid010c14b4.msg:003e:0x00002F00:005c:3=I am so moved, deep in my soul! You are a genius of the dance!
uid010c14b4.msg:000d:0x00002F3F:0068:4=You think so?
uid010c14b4.msg:0065:0x00002F4D:0074:5=Certainly! I think you might be better than I am! I swear, you could be a professional if you wanted!
uid010c14b4.msg:0050:0x00002FB3:0080:6=(Okay, now he's just flattering me... Heh, but at least we're both entertained.)
uid010c14b4.msg:0030:0x00003004:008c:7=All right, next dance! Show us some more, Saito!
uid010c14b4.msg:0019:0x00003035:0098:8=More? On top of all that?
uid010c14b4.msg:003d:0x0000304F:00a4:9=Of course. With your natural talent, I'd be crazy not to ask.
uid010c14b4.msg:0012:0x0000308D:00b0:10=Well, all right...
uid010c14b4.msg:0030:0x000030A0:00bc:11=I think you've got two left feet, Saito! Hahaha!
uid010c14b4.msg:0018:0x000030D1:00c8:12=Sorry if I offended you?
uid010c14b4.msg:0078:0x000030EA:00d4:13=Oh, don't apologize. You're probably as coordinated as any swordsman out there. You just need practice moving to a beat!
uid010c14b4.msg:003e:0x00003163:00e0:14=(Heh, at least he knows how to keep an entertainer motivated.)
uid010c14b4.msg:0027:0x000031A2:00ec:15=All right, go again, Saito! Next dance!
uid010c14b4.msg:000b:0x000031CA:00f8:16=What? More?
uid010c14b4.msg:004c:0x000031D6:0104:17=Of course. I said you'd get better with practice! So let's see you practice!
uid010c14b4.msg:0005:0x00003223:0110:18=Mm...
uid010c14b4.msg:002d:0x0000322D:014c:19=Whew... Dancing really takes it out of you...
uid010c14b4.msg:0041:0x0000325B:0158:20=Sure does! But are you really that tired already? Buck up, Saito!
uid010c14b4.msg:0017:0x0000329D:0164:21=No can do... I'm spent.
uid010c14b4.msg:000d:0x000032B5:0170:22=Okay, okay...
uid010c14b4.msg:0017:0x000032C3:017c:23=Wait... By the gods...!
uid010c14b4.msg:0027:0x000032DB:0188:24=Kanda-san? Has another idea struck you?
uid010c14b4.msg:0070:0x00003303:0194:25=Yes, the muse of dance herself is speaking to me. Nay, yelling at me! All because I've been watching you, Saito!
uid010c14b4.msg:0017:0x00003374:01a0:26=Really? I did all that?
uid010c14b4.msg:0064:0x0000338C:01ac:27=Mmm... I sense my hand being possessed once again! Get me a brush and paper that I may capture this!
uid010c14b4.msg:000f:0x000033F1:01b8:28=Again!? Okay...
uid010c14b4.msg:000d:0x0000340C:0248:29=Whew... Done.
uid010c14b4.msg:004b:0x0000341A:0254:30=(He did it all in one go again. Just goes to show how talented the man is.)
uid010c14b4.msg:0039:0x00003466:0260:31=Behold! My interpretation of your whirling body in dance!
uid010c14b4.msg:0011:0x000034A0:026c:32=(Wow, this is...)
uid010c14b4.msg:0025:0x000034B2:0278:33=(...Just as bizarre as the last one!)
uid010c14b4.msg:0043:0x000034D8:0284:34=What do you think, Saito? Did I produce two amazing works in a row?
uid010c14b4.msg:002b:0x0000351C:0290:35=Y-Yeah! Amazing's one way to describe it...
uid010c14b4.msg:0042:0x00003548:029c:36=Can you give me a little more detail? What is it you find amazing?
uid010c14b4.msg:0059:0x0000358B:02a8:37=The brushstrokes are bold, yet elegant. It's incredible how you blended the two concepts.
uid010c14b4.msg:001c:0x000035E5:02b4:38=Bold yet elegant, you say...
uid010c14b4.msg:005c:0x00003602:02c0:39=That's perfect! Exactly what I wanted to express with this drawing. And clearly I succeeded!
uid010c14b4.msg:001f:0x0000365F:02cc:40=(Nice, I said the right thing.)
uid010c14b4.msg:0044:0x0000367F:02d8:41=Saito, you could become an artist if you really put your mind to it.
uid010c14b4.msg:0014:0x000036C4:02e4:42=Heh, you flatter me.
uid010c14b4.msg:005f:0x000036D9:02f0:43=The brushstrokes are crude, but they give off a sense of strength. Like being swept downstream.
uid010c14b4.msg:0027:0x00003739:02fc:44=You think my brushstrokes are... crude?
uid010c14b4.msg:005b:0x00003761:0308:45=Well, that's... disappointing. I don't see how you could possibly say they're <i>crude</i>.
uid010c14b4.msg:0028:0x000037BD:0314:46=(Damn. I didn't mean to offend the guy.)
uid010c14b4.msg:0042:0x000037E6:0320:47=Maybe you should train your eyes a bit more, Saito. Study up some.
uid010c14b4.msg:000c:0x00003829:032c:48=Uh... Right.
uid010c14b4.msg:0033:0x00003836:0338:49=All I know is that it's awe-inspiring. Enough said.
uid010c14b4.msg:006a:0x00003871:0350:50=Hahaha, perhaps that's all that <i>should</i> be said! After all, art doesn't always need to be explained.
uid010c14b4.msg:001e:0x000038DC:035c:51=(That seemed to do the trick.)
uid010c14b4.msg:004f:0x000038FB:0368:52=I shouldn't expect you to talk like a critic anyhow. Thanks for the compliment.
uid010c14b4.msg:0008:0x0000394B:0374:53=...Sure.
uid010c14b4.msg:002f:0x00003956:0398:54=Ready to strut your stuff, Saito!? Go on, then!
uid010c14b4.msg:0025:0x00003986:03a4:55=You really are excited, aren't you...
uid010c14b4.msg:003e:0x000039AC:03b0:56=(Do I really have to dance, too? Well... Why not make it fun?)
uid010c14b6.msg:006c:0x0000336C:0048:1=As you know, I had a son. Very talented boy. He was a great artist just like his pop, if I do say so myself.
uid010c14b6.msg:0006:0x000033D9:0054:2="Was"?
uid010c14b6.msg:0048:0x000033E0:0060:3=Mm... A few years back, he did the unthinkable... and took his own life.
uid010c14b6.msg:0064:0x0000342B:0078:4=You see, when your old man is someone like me, who's been good at everything he's put his hand to...
uid010c14b6.msg:0049:0x00003490:0084:5=Well, it can wear on you, because people won't stop with the comparisons.
uid010c14b6.msg:005c:0x000034DA:0090:6="The kid doesn't have his father's talent," that sort of thing. A life of endless criticism.
uid010c14b6.msg:0048:0x00003537:009c:7=And in the end, he couldn't bear the burden of living under my shadow...
uid010c14b6.msg:001b:0x00003580:00a8:8=...I'm sorry that happened.
uid010c14b6.msg:003b:0x0000359C:00b4:9=Wouldn't you know it, today's the anniversary of his death.
uid010c14b6.msg:0078:0x000035D8:00c0:10=That's why I didn't want to be alone in my house, so I made my way to Kyo. But then I was just alone in a foreign place.
uid010c14b6.msg:0076:0x00003651:00cc:11=But then you showed up. And I noticed immediately that you were my son's age. That brought back some happy memories...
uid010c14b6.msg:001b:0x000036C8:00d8:12=I don't know what to say...
uid010c14b6.msg:0021:0x000036E4:00e4:13=Well. I'm grateful to you, Saito.
uid010c14b6.msg:0031:0x00003706:00f0:14=I haven't had this much fun in a long, long time.
uid010c14b6.msg:007e:0x00003739:0108:15=I'm glad I got to see you sing and dance! Those skills, plus your eye for art, makes me confident you could be a great artist!
uid010c14b6.msg:0070:0x000037B8:0114:16=Heh, I never expected flattery from someone of your reputation. You know how to make an entertainer entertained.
uid010c14b6.msg:001a:0x00003829:0120:17=Gahaha! I won't deny that!
uid010c14b6.msg:0023:0x00003844:012c:18=I enjoyed your singing and dancing!

uid010c14b6.msg:003d:0x00003926:0168:23=Gahaha! Try harder next time and you won't be so embarrassed!
uid010c14b6.msg:0049:0x00003964:0174:24=All right, well, I've had my fill of Kyo. I'd better head back to my inn.
uid010c14b6.msg:0016:0x000039AE:0180:25=Have a safe trip back.

uid010c14b6.msg:0073:0x00003B1F:027c:33=(He seemed like he had a really good time. In fact... I think I might have filled a void in that old heart of his.)

uid010c14b6.msg:004e:0x00003D14:0330:42=Okay! All this singing and dancing has me tuckered out. Time to call it a day.
uid010c14b6.msg:0043:0x00003D63:033c:43=Wait a minute, but I was the one performing. What got you so tired?
uid010c14b6.msg:004e:0x00003DA7:0348:44=Because it took twice as much energy watching you! A lot goes through my head!
uid010c14b6.msg:000a:0x00003DF6:0354:45=Huh. Okay.

uid010c14b6.msg:0035:0x00003E85:0390:50=...Somehow, I don't get the feeling they're admirers.
uid010c14b6.msg:0039:0x00003EBB:039c:51=Heh, so the rumors about you being in the city were true.
uid010c14b6.msg:003e:0x00003EF5:03a8:52=Hey, is kidnapping this guy really going to make us any money?
uid010c14b6.msg:003e:0x00003F34:03b4:53=Of course. Kanda's a god to his fans. And the whole art world!

uid010c14b6.msg:003c:0x000040BC:0420:61=Don't worry. This'll be over soon. Just hide somewhere safe.
uid010c14b6.msg:0021:0x000040F9:042c:62=Don't die. Just don't die, Saito!
uid010c14b6.msg:0013:0x0000411B:0438:63=I don't plan on it.
uid010c14b6.msg:0045:0x0000412F:0444:64=Then you'd better make a new plan... in hell! Flay him alive, fellas!

uid010c14d7.msg:0073:0x000055A6:0144:19=But still, you were the one who held back at first. You knew I'd come out if I heard what was going on, didn't you?

uid010c1511.msg:002d:0x00002316:0054:2=It's fine, I didn't do it expecting anything.
uid010c1511.msg:007f:0x00002344:0060:3=You've got a pure soul, sir samurai. I'm sure the gods are as impressed with you as I am. They shall grant you Virtue for this.
uid010c1511.msg:0007:0x000023C4:006c:4=Virtue?
uid010c1511.msg:007c:0x000023CC:0078:5=Oh yes. The locals here have known since the olden times that the gods will bestow praise and Virtue upon those who do good.
uid010c1511.msg:0097:0x00002449:0084:6=You could cultivate all the Virtue you want by going around this town punishing the wicked. And by good deeds too, but that's less exciting, of course.

uid010c1511.msg:0079:0x00002583:00a8:9=Well I understand why people like you think so, but it's all true. Look, I think you've cultivated some Virtue right now!
uid010c1511.msg:00bf:0x000025FF:00cc:10=You cultivate Virtue by doing good deeds for the town and its people, like helping them solve their problems or shopping at their local shops. You can then exchange your Virtue for blessings.
uid010c1511.msg:00b8:0x000026BF:00d8:11=And whenever you do things which cultivate Virtue, your reputation around town will improve. The residents will treat you with more kindness, making it easier to conduct your business.

uid010c1511.msg:004c:0x00002839:00fc:14=Right? That's how Virtue feels! Cultivate Virtue just like that, bit by bit.
uid010c1511.msg:0032:0x00002886:0108:15=Bit by bit? You make it sound like a slow process.
uid010c1511.msg:0039:0x000028B9:0114:16=True, but there are ways to earn a lot of Virtue quickly.
uid010c1511.msg:004f:0x000028F3:0120:17=Namely, following the Diligence Records! It's part of the divine plan, you see!

uid010c1511.msg:006c:0x00002969:0138:19=Oh. It's a document that's been circulating around here. It's a collection of divine requests from the gods.
uid010c1511.msg:0047:0x000029D6:0144:20=Anyone who fulfills those requests will gain plenty of Virtue, quickly.
uid010c1511.msg:005b:0x00002A1E:0150:21=Oh, I just thought of something I can do to repay you for helping me! I'll give you a copy.

uid010c1511.msg:00c9:0x00002BBF:0198:25=Oh, not at all, especially not for someone as capable as you, sir samurai. These tasks are such that someone like you completes just by living life. You'll rake in lots of Virtue without even noticing.
uid010c1511.msg:0078:0x00002C89:01a4:26=Once you have enough Virtue and you're ready to exchange it for a blessing from the gods, just visit a shrine or temple!
uid010c1511.msg:009f:0x00002D02:01b0:27=Visit temples and shrines to exchange your Virtue for blessings, which can increase the capacity of your inventory and grant you other benefits. Use them well!
uid010c1511.msg:005e:0x00002DA2:01bc:28=That's about as much as I can explain, I think. But if you forget any of it, just come ask me!

uid010c1511.msg:0046:0x00002EFA:0228:35=Oh. Well actually, I think I twisted my leg when they knocked me down.
uid010c1511.msg:0078:0x00002F41:0234:36=I'm so sorry to ask, but do you think you could help me walk back to the temple? I could just lean on your shoulder? Ow!

uid010c151a.msg:0077:0x000009C4:0070:5=Oh, didn't I mention? That temple where we met, over in Fushimi, wasn't mine. I was just visiting it for some business.
uid010c151a.msg:0027:0x00000A3C:007c:6=Right, you did say something like that.
uid010c151a.msg:006a:0x00000A64:0088:7=Yes, from now on I'll be at the shrine down the street. If you have the time, I'd love for you to drop by.

uid010c1657.msg:0054:0x00002E2F:0160:26=I was actually watching you—trying to figure out why you keep winding up out cold.
uid010c1657.msg:0032:0x00002E84:016c:27=Whoa! I had no idea... Well, did you see anything?
uid010c1657.msg:004e:0x00002EB7:0178:28=No. You didn't even get knocked out this time. I have no idea what's going on.
uid010c1657.msg:0080:0x00002F06:0184:29=Yeah, me neither... but I have been thinking about it, and I wonder, maybe I keep collapsing because of some mysterious illness.
uid010c1657.msg:0031:0x00002F87:0190:30=Hmm... You seem pretty healthy for it to be that.
uid010c1657.msg:006b:0x00002FB9:019c:31=No, no, it <i>has</i> to be something! Some kind of sickness that takes a real thorough inspection to find!

uid010c1657.msg:0048:0x000030F7:0238:37=I see now—you kept knocking yourself out on... whatever that thing is.
uid010c1657.msg:0091:0x00003140:0244:38=Oww... Yes, I'd say we finally cracked the case. I always pass that spot when I go down this path, so I guess I just slipped on it over and over.
uid010c1657.msg:0057:0x000031D2:0250:39=Pretty weird, though... How can something like that make a person slip so consistently?
uid010c1657.msg:0077:0x0000322A:025c:40=Right? I'm glad it didn't turn out to be some weird illness, but... this thing seems like trouble. What is it, exactly?
uid010c1657.msg:002b:0x000032A2:0268:41=I don't know... Could be some new weapon...
uid010c1657.msg:000a:0x000032CE:0274:42=A weapon!?
uid010c1657.msg:0051:0x000032D9:0280:43=I mean, look what it's put <i>you</i> through. We can't rule the possibility out.
uid010c1657.msg:0048:0x0000332B:028c:44=How awful... You think someone's been using me to test out a new weapon?
uid010c1657.msg:0064:0x00003374:0298:45=There's always a chance... What's this thing even made of, though? I've never seen anything like it.
uid010c1657.msg:0085:0x000033D9:02a4:46=Maybe someone brought it from overseas...? Whatever it is, now that I know it's been doing me in, I'm gonna steer clear of the thing.
uid010c1657.msg:0018:0x0000345F:02b0:47=Sounds like a good idea.
uid010c1657.msg:0081:0x00003478:02bc:48=Well, you shouldn't have to worry about finding me laid out anymore. Thanks so much for your help. This is for all your troubles.

uid01160706.msg:002f:0x00009CB4:02d0:7=Obtained <Color:8>Virtuous Hood<Color:Default>.
uid01160706.msg:003a:0x00009CE5:02e8:8=No problem. Let me know if there's anything else I can do.
uid01160706.msg:002a:0x00009D20:02f4:9=Heehee, hopefully we won't need you again!
uid01160706.msg:0026:0x00009D4B:0300:10=By the way, what will happen to Akumi?
uid01160706.msg:0063:0x00009D72:030c:11=We considered turning him in to the magistrate, but I doubt he would've been judged properly there.
uid01160706.msg:004d:0x00009DD6:0318:12=Yeah. It's a difficult allegation to prove; brainwashing people with incense.
uid01160706.msg:0077:0x00009E24:0324:13=Right. But then, Akumi was only able to accomplish such a strange feat because of his knowledge and skills as a doctor.
uid01160706.msg:0060:0x00009E9C:0330:14=So, we're putting him to work for us. You've taught us a lot about making allies out of enemies.
uid01160706.msg:001d:0x00009F00:0360:15=Does that mean he's here now?
uid01160706.msg:0059:0x00009F1E:036c:16=He is. He wanted to apologize to you, actually, Saito-san. Go say hi to him, if you like.
uid01160706.msg:0007:0x00009F78:0378:17=Got it.
uid01160706.msg:0028:0x00009F80:0384:18=Heehee, come back soon. I'll be waiting!
uid01160706.msg:0019:0x00009FA9:0390:19=Hm? Where is Lady Omatsu?
uid01160706.msg:001c:0x00009FC3:039c:20=Hey! Has anyone seen Omatsu?
uid01160706.msg:0028:0x00009FE0:03a8:21=She just left. Said she'd be right back.
uid01160706.msg:000b:0x0000A009:03b4:22=Hm. Thanks.
uid01160706.msg:0037:0x0000A015:03c0:23=I should head to the river that Jozo mentioned for now.
uid01160706.msg:0029:0x0000A04D:03cc:24=Understood. Please be careful, Saito-san.
uid01160706.msg:003d:0x0000A077:03d8:25=I will. You stay here and keep an eye on Jozo and the others.
uid01160706.msg:0003:0x0000A0B5:03e4:26=Hm?
uid01160706.msg:0037:0x0000A0B9:03f0:27=A new request has been posted... I should check it out.
uid01160706.msg:0016:0x0000A0F1:03fc:28=Great work, Saito-san!
uid01160706.msg:0034:0x0000A108:0408:29=I did all that I could. Have you found out anything?
uid01160706.msg:004f:0x0000A13D:0414:30=Yes. It seems like the leader of the Jozo Tengu is behind this new crime spree.
uid01160706.msg:0072:0x0000A18D:0420:31=When we questioned one of the tengu you sent here, he let us know that the others would be at a shrine in Rakunai.
uid01160706.msg:0057:0x0000A200:042c:32=Saito-san, I think they're waiting for you. Please make sure you're ready for anything!
uid01160706.msg:0007:0x0000A258:0438:33=I will.
uid01160706.msg:004e:0x0000A260:0444:34=Saito-san! I was able to locate Red Ninja! He's in Rakunai, at a shrine there.
uid01160706.msg:003b:0x0000A2AF:0450:35=Though, I beg you, don't kill him! He's a good man, really.
uid01160706.msg:0018:0x0000A2EB:045c:36=I understand. Calm down.
uid01160706.msg:0036:0x0000A304:0468:37=You said he was at a shrine? Just like the Jozo Tengu?
uid01160706.msg:0040:0x0000A33B:0474:38=Right. They must be connected. No choice but to go there myself.
uid01160706.msg:0017:0x0000A37C:0480:39=Saito-san... Take care.
uid01160706.msg:000f:0x0000A394:048c:40=Leave it to me.
uid01160706.msg:0034:0x0000A3A4:0498:41=Don't forget to check the request board for details!
uid01160706.msg:0006:0x0000A3D9:04a4:42=Right.
uid01160706.msg:0007:0x0000A3E0:04b0:43=Phew...
uid01160706.msg:000e:0x0000A3E8:04bc:44=You all right?
uid01160706.msg:0032:0x0000A3F7:04c8:45=Aw, I'm fine. Things are just really busy outside.
uid01160706.msg:0049:0x0000A42A:04d4:46=I've posted three more requests. Please, report in once they're finished.
uid01160706.msg:0006:0x0000A474:04e0:47=On it.
uid01160706.msg:0074:0x0000A47B:04ec:48=Saito-san, great work! Thanks to you, both the Chivalrous Shinobi and the Touken Clan have ended their crime sprees.
uid01160706.msg:0046:0x0000A4F0:04f8:49=Things are actually quiet for once. I can only hope it stays this way.
uid01160706.msg:002e:0x0000A537:0504:50=Unfortunately, I don't imagine this will keep.
uid01160706.msg:0042:0x0000A566:0510:51=You're right, and that's why the Tachibanagumi will stay cautious.
uid01160706.msg:0032:0x0000A5A9:051c:52=Have you learned anything more about that incense?
uid01160706.msg:005d:0x0000A5DC:0528:53=I asked a merchant in Fushimi. He told me that he's seen a strange doctor dealing in incense.
uid01160706.msg:0030:0x0000A63A:0534:54=But sadly, that's all anyone can seem to dig up.
uid01160706.msg:0006:0x0000A66B:0540:55=I see.
uid01160706.msg:0041:0x0000A672:054c:56=But don't let that discourage you, Saito-san! You've earned this.
uid01160706.msg:0027:0x0000A6B4:0558:57=Obtained <Color:8>4 ryo<Color:Default>.
uid01160706.msg:004c:0x0000A6DC:0564:58=Whatever else comes our way, I hope we can still count on you in the future!
uid01160706.msg:001b:0x0000A729:0570:59=Mm. I'll try to do my part.
uid01160706.msg:0018:0x0000A745:057c:60=Omatsu-san! This is bad!
uid01160706.msg:0038:0x0000A75E:0588:61=Tengu, ninja, and ronin are all running rampant outside!
uid01160706.msg:0018:0x0000A797:0594:62=Wha—What do you mean!?
uid01160706.msg:0029:0x0000A7B0:05a0:63=I'm not sure what happened, but listen...
uid01160706.msg:0004:0x0000A7DE:05dc:64=Eh!?
uid01160706.msg:0035:0x0000A7E3:05e8:65=I'm going back out there. I'll report in again later.
uid01160706.msg:0023:0x0000A819:05f4:66=How could this be? What's going on?
uid01160706.msg:0040:0x0000A83D:0600:67=We won't find answers standing here. I should go see for myself.
uid01160706.msg:001a:0x0000A87E:060c:68=You'll help us, Saito-san?
uid01160706.msg:005f:0x0000A899:0618:69=Yeah. I've come this far... And whoever's behind this, I can't abide the methods they're using.
uid01160706.msg:0025:0x0000A8F9:0624:70=Thank you! Just wait here a moment...
uid01160706.msg:0045:0x0000A922:0654:71=There. I've posted requests to make it official! Please, take a look.
uid01160706.msg:0019:0x0000A968:0660:72=And be careful out there!
uid01160706.msg:0007:0x0000A982:066c:73=I will.
uid01160706.msg:003d:0x0000A98A:0678:74=Thank you, Saito-san. Tojiro-san still needs time to recover.
uid01160706.msg:0028:0x0000A9C8:0684:75=Please come back and check on him later.
uid01160706.msg:0031:0x0000A9F2:069c:76=Saito-san, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
uid01160706.msg:0038:0x0000AA24:06a8:77=No need to thank me. I'm glad to see Oharu's doing well.
uid01160706.msg:0026:0x0000AA5D:06b4:78=She wasn't sick at all! What a relief!
uid01160706.msg:0031:0x0000AA84:06c0:79=Well said, but that doctor is beyond forgiveness!
uid01160706.msg:0075:0x0000AAB6:06cc:80=That's right. I can't believe he lied to Tojiro-san and the rest of you, just to pressure you into robbing townsfolk!
uid01160706.msg:0032:0x0000AB2C:06d8:81=That doctor has to be the one pulling the strings.
uid01160706.msg:0026:0x0000AB5F:06e4:82=Can Tojiro or the others identify him?
uid01160706.msg:0064:0x0000AB86:06f0:83=As expected, their memories aren't all there yet. It's going to be hard getting any clues from them.
uid01160706.msg:002e:0x0000ABEB:06fc:84=I see. Well, let me know if anything turns up.
uid01160706.msg:0024:0x0000AC1A:0708:85=Of course. Don't forget your reward!
uid01160706.msg:0027:0x0000AC3F:0714:86=Obtained <Color:8>5 ryo<Color:Default>.
uid01160706.msg:0034:0x0000AC67:0720:87=The Chivalrous Shinobi owe you a great debt as well.
uid01160706.msg:0012:0x0000AC9C:072c:88=Please, take this.
uid01160706.msg:0034:0x0000ACAF:0738:89=Obtained <Color:8>Tear of the Dragon<Color:Default>.
uid01160706.msg:007b:0x0000ACE5:0750:90=We plan to return everything that we stole. Someday, we will once more earn the right to call ourselves Chivalrous Shinobi!
uid01160706.msg:001e:0x0000AD61:075c:91=I don't doubt that. Good luck.
uid01160706.msg:0051:0x0000AD80:0768:92=Green Ninja-san... He seemed very worried. Saito-san, please help him if you can.
uid01160706.msg:0036:0x0000ADD2:0774:93=Oh, right. There should be a new request on the board.
uid01160706.msg:0007:0x0000AE09:0780:94=Got it.
uid01160706.msg:0030:0x0000AE12:0798:95=Saito-san, I just got word from Green Ninja-san!
uid01160706.msg:0036:0x0000AE43:07a4:96=Your suspicion about the doctor might just be correct.
uid01160706.msg:004b:0x0000AE7A:07b0:97=That doctor's not only met with Tojiro-san, but many other shinobi as well!
uid01160706.msg:0007:0x0000AEC6:07bc:98=Really?
uid01160706.msg:004b:0x0000AECE:07c8:99=And anyone who met with him supposedly started acting weird soon afterward!
uid01160706.msg:005e:0x0000AF1A:07d4:100=There's more trouble within the Chivalrous Shinobi than Green Ninja-san can handle on his own.
uid01160706.msg:004d:0x0000AF79:07e0:101=Saito-san, I'd like you to go to the ninja's hideout and see what's going on.
uid01160706.msg:0032:0x0000AFC7:07ec:102=Tojiro should be there, right? It might get rough.
uid01160706.msg:0070:0x0000AFFA:07f8:103=Green Ninja-san said he'll be waiting for you at North Yashikimachi. He'll take you to their hideout from there.
uid01160706.msg:0038:0x0000B06B:0804:104=As always, please check the request board before you go!
uid01160706.msg:0007:0x0000B0A4:0810:105=Got it.
uid01160706.msg:000f:0x0000B0AC:081c:106=And be careful!
uid01160706.msg:0036:0x0000B0BC:0828:107=Looks like you were able to take care of that request.
uid01160706.msg:0013:0x0000B0F3:0834:108=Here's your reward!
uid01160706.msg:0027:0x0000B107:0840:109=Obtained <Color:8>3 ryo<Color:Default>.
uid01160706.msg:0029:0x0000B12F:084c:110=Thank you. I'll be counting on you again.
uid01160706.msg:0056:0x0000B15A:0864:111=I hope Green Ninja-san's okay. We still haven't heard from him... I'm getting worried.
uid01160706.msg:0029:0x0000B1B1:0870:112=Looks like you took care of that request.
uid01160706.msg:0055:0x0000B1DB:087c:113=Yeah, but something's bothering me. I was able to talk to one of them, a green ninja.
uid01160706.msg:005d:0x0000B231:0888:114=I think someone might be influencing them. He mentioned a doctor providing them with incense.
uid01160706.msg:0044:0x0000B28F:0894:115=If that's the case, I can help! I'll see if I can find out anything.
uid01160706.msg:003c:0x0000B2D4:08a0:116=Green Ninja might contact you with more information. Thanks.
uid01160706.msg:001c:0x0000B311:08ac:117=Thank <i>you</i>, Saito-san!
uid01160706.msg:0027:0x0000B32E:08b8:118=Obtained <Color:8>3 ryo<Color:Default>.

uid01160706.msg:0006:0x0000B375:08d0:120=*sigh*
uid01160706.msg:0026:0x0000B37C:08dc:121=What's wrong? You don't look too good.
uid01160706.msg:007a:0x0000B3A3:08e8:122=Oh, Saito-san, I didn't see you. There's just a lot of paperwork lately, and not enough people to fill all these requests.
uid01160706.msg:0016:0x0000B41E:08f4:123=It's all a bit much...
uid01160706.msg:001d:0x0000B435:0900:124=Don't push yourself too hard.
uid01160706.msg:006f:0x0000B453:090c:125=Heehee, thank you. You've been doing a great job on your requests, though, Saito-san! I need to do my best too!
uid01160706.msg:0036:0x0000B4C3:0918:126=That must've really been tough. Great work, Saito-san!
uid01160706.msg:0037:0x0000B4FA:0924:127=The Touken members are resting now while we treat them.
uid01160706.msg:000c:0x0000B532:0930:128=That's good.
uid01160706.msg:001f:0x0000B53F:093c:129=Are you hurt at all, Saito-san?
uid01160706.msg:0049:0x0000B55F:0948:130=No, I'm fine. Did you find anything out about the swords or that incense?
uid01160706.msg:0081:0x0000B5A9:0954:131=Their swords seem like just normal katana. The incense too. Actually, I was feeling brave so I inhaled a bit of it, but I'm fine.
uid01160706.msg:0038:0x0000B62B:0960:132=I see. I thought for sure they'd give us a clue somehow.
uid01160706.msg:004a:0x0000B664:096c:133=It's almost like they were all possessed by some kind of mysterious force!
uid01160706.msg:0055:0x0000B6AF:0978:134=I got that feeling too. In every fight, it seemed like they had no will of their own.
uid01160706.msg:004f:0x0000B705:0984:135=Maybe there's something we're missing here, besides the katana and the incense?
uid01160706.msg:005d:0x0000B755:0990:136=At any rate, there must be a mastermind that's been manipulating the Touken Clan in some way.
uid01160706.msg:0026:0x0000B7B3:099c:137=Maybe! But what would their reason be?
uid01160706.msg:005f:0x0000B7DA:09a8:138=I don't know, but anyone capable of bending others to their will like that needs to be stopped.
uid01160706.msg:002a:0x0000B83A:09b4:139=Let me know if you find out anything else.
uid01160706.msg:000a:0x0000B865:09c0:140=Of course!
uid01160706.msg:0036:0x0000B870:09cc:141=Here's your reward. I put in a little extra this time!

uid01160706.msg:000e:0x0000B979:0a08:145=Right, I will.
uid01160706.msg:001f:0x0000B988:0a14:146=There you are. Are you all set?
uid01160706.msg:0013:0x0000B9A8:0a20:147=(What should I do?)
uid01160706.msg:0035:0x0000B9BC:0a2c:148=I'll need to prepare a bit before I go. Can you wait?
uid01160706.msg:0019:0x0000B9F2:0a38:149=No problem. I'll be here!
uid01160706.msg:0007:0x0000BA0D:0a50:150=Thanks.
uid01160706.msg:0037:0x0000BA15:0a5c:151=I'm ready. I should go before more people get attacked.
uid01160706.msg:0034:0x0000BA4D:0a68:152=Right. I'll call a palanquin. Be careful, Saito-san!
uid01160706.msg:000a:0x0000BA83:0a80:153=Saito-san.
uid01160706.msg:003d:0x0000BA8E:0a8c:154=Something's happened. The ronin you brought in have all left.
uid01160706.msg:0005:0x0000BACC:0a98:155=What?
uid01160706.msg:005d:0x0000BAD2:0aa4:156=They all suddenly got up and hobbled outside. I called out to them, but they wouldn't answer!
uid01160706.msg:004b:0x0000BB30:0ab0:157=It was bizarre! All I could do was have one of the Tachibanagumi tail them.
uid01160706.msg:0055:0x0000BB7C:0abc:158=I did find something out, though. Apparently, they're all members of the Touken Clan.
uid01160706.msg:0010:0x0000BBD2:0ac8:159=The Touken Clan?
uid01160706.msg:0084:0x0000BBE3:0ad4:160=It's a social club for samurai who collect rare swords as a hobby. Lately, though, it seems like members have been acting strangely!
uid01160706.msg:0011:0x0000BC68:0ae0:161=What do you mean?
uid01160706.msg:0075:0x0000BC7A:0aec:162=I've been asking around, talking to their families and friends. Until recently, they were all kind, courteous people.
uid01160706.msg:0065:0x0000BCF0:0af8:163=The Touken Clan only accepts collectors who believe in samurai ideals and uphold a strict moral code.
uid01160706.msg:0082:0x0000BD56:0b04:164=But now, they've started staying out until late at night and don't respond when people talk to them. I hear it's a drastic change!
uid01160706.msg:0049:0x0000BDD9:0b10:165=And the samurai that have been attacking me are all members of this clan?
uid01160706.msg:003a:0x0000BE23:0b1c:166=It seems that way! So, I've looked into the Touken Clan...
uid01160706.msg:0052:0x0000BE5E:0b28:167=They have a usual meeting place, and people are still coming and going from there.
uid01160706.msg:0036:0x0000BEB1:0b34:168=I see. So, I should head there myself and investigate.
uid01160706.msg:0077:0x0000BEE8:0b40:169=I'd be grateful if you could, but please be careful! Touken members aren't merely hobbyists, they're skilled swordsmen!
uid01160706.msg:006a:0x0000BF60:0b4c:170=And judging by the ones you've brought in so far, you might not be able to get through to them by talking.
uid01160706.msg:000e:0x0000BFCB:0b58:171=Right, got it.
uid01160706.msg:0067:0x0000BFDA:0b64:172=Their hideout is a bit far from here. Let me know when you're ready and I can call a palanquin for you.
uid01160706.msg:0010:0x0000C042:0b70:173=What do you say?
uid01160706.msg:0035:0x0000C053:0b7c:174=I'll need to prepare a bit before I go. Can you wait?
uid01160706.msg:0019:0x0000C089:0b88:175=No problem. I'll be here!
uid01160706.msg:0007:0x0000C0A4:0ba0:176=Thanks.
uid01160706.msg:0037:0x0000C0AF:0bd0:177=I'm ready. I should go before more people get attacked.
uid01160706.msg:0034:0x0000C0E7:0bdc:178=Right. I'll call a palanquin. Be careful, Saito-san!
uid01160706.msg:002b:0x0000C11D:0bf4:179=Thank you for helping out Akumi, Saito-san.
uid01160706.msg:0037:0x0000C149:0c00:180=To think you'd be ambushed by so many men on the way...
uid01160706.msg:0077:0x0000C181:0c0c:181=Could they have been following you? Saito-san, can you think of a reason someone might be holding a grudge against you?
uid01160706.msg:0022:0x0000C1F9:0c18:182=I'd be lying if I said I couldn't.
uid01160706.msg:0069:0x0000C21C:0c24:183=The ronin you brought in before are still under watch here, so it wasn't them. I'm still worried, though.
uid01160706.msg:001c:0x0000C286:0c30:184=Any updates on the last two?
uid01160706.msg:0063:0x0000C2A3:0c3c:185=They haven't woken up. Akumi was here to take a look at them, but he can't figure out what's wrong.
uid01160706.msg:002b:0x0000C307:0c48:186=I see. Well, let me know when they come to.
uid01160706.msg:0029:0x0000C333:0c54:187=Sure thing. Great job today! Here you go.
uid01160706.msg:0027:0x0000C35D:0c60:188=Obtained <Color:8>2 ryo<Color:Default>.
uid01160706.msg:0007:0x0000C385:0c6c:189=Thanks.
uid01160706.msg:0047:0x0000C38D:0c78:190=Oh, Saito-san, great timing! There's something I need to ask you to do.
uid01160706.msg:0010:0x0000C3D5:0c84:191=Another request?
uid01160706.msg:000a:0x0000C3E6:0c90:192=Yes, here!
uid01160706.msg:004b:0x0000C3F2:0ca8:193=I couldn't trust this to just anyone. I'd like you to handle it personally.
uid01160706.msg:007d:0x0000C43E:0cb4:194=With robberies during the day and violence at night, things are far too dangerous! So, I'd like you to escort someone for me.
uid01160706.msg:0024:0x0000C4BC:0cc0:195=Inabara Akumi. Pleasure to meet you.
uid01160706.msg:002b:0x0000C4E1:0ccc:196=What do you say, could you do it right now?
uid01160706.msg:001c:0x0000C50D:0cd8:197=Sure. Where am I taking him?
uid01160706.msg:007b:0x0000C52A:0ce4:198=A mansion near Shikokuya in Rakunai. Akumi is a doctor, and we've been friends since we were kids. Please look out for him.
uid01160706.msg:000f:0x0000C5A6:0cf0:199=Right, will do.
uid01160706.msg:0015:0x0000C5B6:0cfc:200=Mind if we get going?
uid01160706.msg:001c:0x0000C5CC:0d08:201=Heheh, I feel safer already.
uid01160706.msg:0069:0x0000C5E9:0d14:202=Ah, but forgive me, there's one errand I have to run. Why don't you meet me at the entrance to Mukurogai?
uid01160706.msg:000b:0x0000C653:0d20:203=Sure, okay.
uid01160706.msg:001f:0x0000C65F:0d2c:204=I'm counting on you, Saito-san.
uid01160706.msg:006f:0x0000C67F:0d38:205=I've finished patching them up. One of our members is watching them for now to make sure they don't try to run.
uid01160706.msg:003d:0x0000C6EF:0d44:206=Any idea what's going on with them? They're acting strange...
uid01160706.msg:0049:0x0000C72D:0d50:207=We're still looking into it. I'll let you know if we figure anything out!
uid01160706.msg:001e:0x0000C777:0d5c:208=All right. I'll stay in touch.
uid01160706.msg:001b:0x0000C796:0d68:209=Anyway, here's your reward!

uid01160706.msg:0050:0x0000C90E:0e04:219=Things are rough out there. The Tachibanagumi just doesn't have enough manpower.
uid01160706.msg:0023:0x0000C95F:0e10:220=I'll be counting on you, Saito-san.
uid01160706.msg:001d:0x0000C983:0e1c:221=Oh, just a moment, Saito-san.
uid01160706.msg:0011:0x0000C9A1:0e28:222=Hm? What's wrong?
uid01160706.msg:0058:0x0000C9B3:0e34:223=A new request just came in. I've posted it up on the board, so please take a look at it.
uid01160706.msg:000e:0x0000CA0C:0e40:224=Right, I will.
uid01160706.msg:0020:0x0000CA1B:0e4c:225=Saito-san, do you have a moment?
uid01160706.msg:001f:0x0000CA3C:0e58:226=I'm not sure how to say this...
uid01160706.msg:000d:0x0000CA5C:0e64:227=What's wrong?
uid01160706.msg:0029:0x0000CA6A:0e70:228=That ronin you brought here? He got away.
uid01160706.msg:001a:0x0000CA94:0e7c:229=What? How did that happen?
uid01160706.msg:0062:0x0000CAAF:0e88:230=After we took care of his wounds, we let him rest. Then, as soon as we took our eyes off of him...
uid01160706.msg:0054:0x0000CB12:0e94:231=I see. Well, don't worry too much about it. I'll bring him back if I find him again.
uid01160706.msg:0026:0x0000CB67:0ea0:232=Please do! I'm truly sorry about this.
uid01160706.msg:0039:0x0000CB8E:0eac:233=The city of Kyo's been buzzing... I hope things are okay.
uid01160706.msg:002c:0x0000CBC8:0eb8:234=So, he just started babbling? How strange...
uid01160706.msg:0031:0x0000CBF5:0ec4:235=Sorry, I didn't know where else I could take him.
uid01160706.msg:005b:0x0000CC27:0ed0:236=It's all right. I'll see if I can get anything more out of him when he comes to his senses.
uid01160706.msg:0024:0x0000CC83:0edc:237=We've got it from here, don't worry.
uid01160706.msg:0020:0x0000CCA8:0ee8:238=Here's your pay for the request.

uid01160706.msg:003e:0x0000CE3F:0fa8:249=I'm so glad you came. I look forward to working with you more.
uid01160706.msg:004a:0x0000CE7E:0fb4:250=A new request has come in. Please, check the board when you have the time.
uid01160706.msg:0054:0x0000CEC9:0fc0:251=Saito-san, amazing! To think you were able to take out the leader of the Jozo Tengu!
uid01160706.msg:0047:0x0000CF1E:0fcc:252=They had numbers, but at the end of the day they were still just thugs.
uid01160706.msg:0046:0x0000CF66:0fd8:253=We're finally making progress toward bringing peace and safety to Kyo.
uid01160706.msg:002b:0x0000CFAD:0fe4:254=Things should be calmer now with Jozo gone!
uid01160706.msg:0010:0x0000CFD9:0ff0:255=Yeah, I hope so.
uid01160706.msg:0019:0x0000CFEA:0ffc:256=Well, here's your reward.
uid01160706.msg:0027:0x0000D004:1008:257=Obtained <Color:8>4 ryo<Color:Default>.
uid01160706.msg:0024:0x0000D02C:1014:258=Thanks again. We're counting on you!
uid01160706.msg:000e:0x0000D052:102c:259=Oh, Saito-san!
uid01160706.msg:004e:0x0000D061:1038:260=You came at just the right time. More Jozo Tengu are causing a ruckus in town.
uid01160706.msg:004a:0x0000D0B0:1044:261=I hear that they're looking for you, too. They must be mad about before...
uid01160706.msg:0043:0x0000D0FB:1050:262=More tengu, huh? Fine, I'll see if I can settle them down for good.
uid01160706.msg:006f:0x0000D13F:105c:263=There are supposedly a lot of them out and about right now, and they're attacking anyone who gets in their way.
uid01160706.msg:0056:0x0000D1AF:1068:264=I've written down their last known location on the request board. I'm counting on you!
uid01160706.msg:000e:0x0000D206:1074:265=Right, got it.
uid01160706.msg:0046:0x0000D216:108c:266=Great job on your first request! Thanks for quieting down those tengu.
uid01160706.msg:003b:0x0000D25D:1098:267=I was coming here to report that. How did you already know?
uid01160706.msg:0044:0x0000D299:10a4:268=As loud as they were? We all heard it when they finally cleared out!
uid01160706.msg:0036:0x0000D2DE:10b0:269=Anyway, thanks for your hard work. Here's your reward!
uid01160706.msg:0027:0x0000D315:10bc:270=Obtained <Color:8>2 ryo<Color:Default>.
uid01160706.msg:0049:0x0000D33D:10c8:271=Who are these guys, really? For thugs, they have some skill between them.
uid01160706.msg:0077:0x0000D387:10d4:272=It seems like that tengu gang attracts people with talent. I think the leader, Jozo, is somewhat inspirational to them.
uid01160706.msg:0057:0x0000D3FF:10e0:273=Personally, I wouldn't be caught dead in one of those gaudy masks! But what can you do?
uid01160706.msg:0030:0x0000D457:10ec:274=Bandits with swordsmanship... Pretty terrifying!
uid01160706.msg:0035:0x0000D488:10f8:275=If another request comes in, please try to handle it!
uid01160706.msg:001e:0x0000D4BE:1104:276=Yeah, I'll come by again soon.
uid01160706.msg:005a:0x0000D4DD:1110:277=Seems like there are no requests right now. Good work! But drop by again later to be safe.
uid01160706.msg:0061:0x0000D539:1128:278=I have high expectations for you! But please, be careful. Things are getting dangerous out there.
uid01160706.msg:0015:0x0000D59B:1134:279=Take care, Saito-san!
uid01160707.msg:004d:0x000006E8:0058:1=Did you hear? That new guy, Saito, took care of that last request on his own.
uid01160707.msg:0026:0x00000736:0064:2=Yeah... Seems like he's pretty strong.
uid01160707.msg:005e:0x0000075D:0070:3=Supposedly, Omatsu-san recruited him herself. Damn, she really handles everything around here.
uid01160707.msg:0047:0x000007BC:007c:4=Well, that's all the more reason we should do our best to help her out!
uid01160707.msg:004b:0x00000805:0094:5=There's a bloody feeling out in Kyo right now, new guy. Stay on your guard.
uid01160707.msg:004d:0x00000851:00a0:6=I hear the Jozo Tengu was beaten back. If that's true, it's a big win for us.
uid01160707.msg:0038:0x0000089F:00ac:7=Wait, was that you, new guy? Huh... Who woulda thunk it?
uid01160707.msg:004f:0x000008D8:00b8:8=The Chivalrous Shinobi sure have turned rotten lately. What's gotten into them?
uid01160707.msg:0047:0x00000928:00c4:9=Rumor is their leader, Tojiro, needs money to care for his sick sister.
uid01160707.msg:0058:0x00000970:00d0:10=Apparently, every one of those ninja love the girl. They'd probably do anything for her.
uid01160707.msg:0065:0x000009C9:00dc:11=Well, I feel bad for 'em, but if it means they're stealing from innocent townsfolk, we gotta step in.
uid01160707.msg:0023:0x00000A2F:00e8:12=Omatsu-san's sure been busy lately.
uid01160707.msg:005d:0x00000A53:00f4:13=Yeah, but the number of requests have been increasing. We've all got our work cut out for us.
uid01160707.msg:0071:0x00000AB1:0100:14=Shit, least we're getting paid. Poor Omatsu-san's gotta handle the paperwork and manage the money all on her own.
uid01160707.msg:005b:0x00000B23:010c:15=Then we owe it to her to work our hardest. Make sure everyone knows the name Tachibanagumi!
uid01160708.msg:003c:0x000012DE:0070:1=(Looks like the guy from the Tachibanagumi request board...)
uid01160708.msg:002b:0x0000131B:007c:2=(Might be pretty strong. What should I do?)
uid01160708.msg:000e:0x00001347:0088:3=Not right now.
uid01160708.msg:002b:0x00001356:0094:4=Hey, you all. You need to quiet down or go.
uid01160708.msg:0050:0x00001383:00ac:5=Huh!? What's that!? You got something to say, you can address me as Tarobo-sama!
uid01160708.msg:003e:0x000013D4:00b8:6=We're trying to enjoy ourselves here! What's wrong with that!?
uid01160708.msg:001a:0x00001413:00c4:7=Customers are complaining.
uid01160708.msg:0012:0x0000142E:00d0:8=Oh yeah? So what!?
uid01160708.msg:0050:0x00001441:00dc:9=*hic* Anybody has a problem... let 'em try to stop us. We're Jozo *hic* Tengu...
uid01160708.msg:008c:0x00001492:00e8:10=Hey, shopkeep, did you hire this do-gooder!? When we kick his ass, you better remember that's what's in store for you if you try this again!
uid01160708.msg:0004:0x0000151F:00f4:11=Eep!
uid01160708.msg:001f:0x00001524:0100:12=I'll take you on, come with me.
uid01160708.msg:004f:0x00001544:010c:13=Tch, you really piss me off! On your feet, boys—we got a beating to hand out!
uid01160708.msg:0060:0x00001598:0148:14=Holler for any tengu hanging around! Let's make sure everyone sees what we do to guys like this!
uid01160708.msg:0007:0x000015F9:0154:15=Yessir!
uid01160708.msg:0010:0x00001603:0178:16=Let's get him!!!
uid01160708.msg:0046:0x00001616:019c:17=What's wrong, done already? If that's all you've got, get out of here.

uid01160708.msg:001e:0x00001683:01b4:19=Against this monster!? We run!
uid01160708.msg:003c:0x000016A2:01c0:20=How could anyone beat us so easily!? We gotta tell the boss!
uid01160708.msg:0058:0x000016E0:01d8:21=I took them for simple thugs, but some of them knew how to use those swords of theirs...
uid01160708.msg:0051:0x00001739:01e4:22=Anyway, that takes care of the request. I should report back to Tachibanagumi HQ.
uid01160726.msg:0011:0x00000804:0048:1=Welcome! Welcome!
uid01160726.msg:0013:0x00000816:0054:2=What is this place?
uid01160726.msg:006c:0x0000082A:0060:3=Why, this is the arena! Here, the strongest fighters in the land gather to see whose might towers above all!
uid01160726.msg:003c:0x00000897:006c:4=Competitors are armed with only their wits—and their arms!
uid01160726.msg:0026:0x000008D4:0078:5=You are welcome to enter, if you dare.
uid01160726.msg:0048:0x000008FB:0084:6=Their arms? Do you mean actual arms, or do you allow the use of weapons?
uid01160726.msg:005a:0x00000944:0090:7=Of course! In this day and age, one's arms are as much a part of their body as their arms!
uid01160726.msg:0067:0x0000099F:009c:8=Wait, did that make sense? I mean, yes! Swords, guns, and any other instrument of death is permissible!
uid01160726.msg:0074:0x00000A07:00a8:9=Naturally, we take no responsibility for our competitors' deaths. The blame in such cases lies solely on their arms!
uid01160726.msg:004c:0x00000A7C:00b4:10=The arena attracts many different kinds, and fights take place at all hours.
uid01160726.msg:0058:0x00000AC9:00c0:11=If you've got faith in your battle prowess, I recommend you attempt the Baptism by Fire.
uid01160726.msg:003b:0x00000B22:00cc:12=I look forward to seeing how you fare... or how you perish!
uid01160726.msg:009c:0x00000B5E:00d8:13=Competitors from across the world come to this arena to battle. The stakes are high, but the rewards are great. If you're feeling courageous, give it a try!

uid01160734.msg:002d:0x0000195D:0050:2=That's right. Jozo, leader of the Jozo Tengu.
uid01160734.msg:001f:0x0000198B:005c:3=(Just like the request said...)
uid01160734.msg:0058:0x000019AB:0068:4=You've been harassing my men. I can't allow the Jozo Tengu to be disrespected like that.
uid01160734.msg:000f:0x00001A05:0080:5=Oi, all of you!
uid01160734.msg:0003:0x00001A15:008c:6=Hm!
uid01160734.msg:0034:0x00001A1A:00a4:7=No one could survive this many of us! Now you die!!!

uid01160734.msg:000a:0x00001A9F:00d4:10=Yes, boss!
uid01160734.msg:0019:0x00001AAA:00e0:11=Time for our last resort!

uid01160734.msg:0010:0x00001AEC:0128:16=This isn't over!
uid01160734.msg:001f:0x00001AFD:0134:17=What are these guys playing at?
uid01160734.msg:001f:0x00001B22:017c:18=Boss, what are we gonna do now?
uid01160734.msg:005f:0x00001B42:0188:19=Listen up! The Jozo Tengu are elite warriors! No way can we let that guy claim victory over us!
uid01160734.msg:0034:0x00001BA2:0194:20=Dammit! Someone think of <i>something</i> we can do!
uid01160734.msg:0007:0x00001BD7:01a0:21=Ummm...
uid01160734.msg:001e:0x00001BDF:01ac:22=Well, we tried running away...
uid01160734.msg:003b:0x00001BFE:01b8:23=Idiots! We're sitting here with piles of crap on our heads!
uid01160734.msg:002e:0x00001C3A:01c4:24=I hate to interrupt, but perhaps I could help?
uid01160734.msg:002e:0x00001C6C:01f4:25=Boss, are you really gonna go along with this?
uid01160734.msg:0021:0x00001C9B:0200:26=Yeah, that guy was fishy as hell!
uid01160734.msg:003b:0x00001CBD:020c:27=Hahaha! Whether we can trust him or not remains to be seen.
uid01160734.msg:0039:0x00001CF9:0218:28=But right now, it would be a waste not to put him to use.
uid01160734.msg:0039:0x00001D33:0224:29=If it's no good, we can always just stab him in the back!
uid01160734.msg:0009:0x00001D6D:0230:30=Clever...
uid01160734.msg:001e:0x00001D77:023c:31=Boss, you're a true tactician!
uid01160734.msg:0038:0x00001D96:0248:32=Hahaha! The Jozo Tengu will have their revenge for sure!
uid0116073f.msg:005f:0x0000023B:00fc:1=(I should head back to Tachibanagumi HQ... Might be able to find some more information there..)

uid01160749.msg:0018:0x00001075:0098:3=He took all my things...
uid01160749.msg:0044:0x0000108E:00a4:4=Tch, that must be the man from the request! Stay here, I'll get him!
uid01160749.msg:000e:0x000010D4:00bc:5=He got away...
uid01160749.msg:002f:0x000010E3:00c8:6=Maybe he'll turn up again if I come back later.
uid01160749.msg:0006:0x00001113:00d4:7=Thief!
uid01160749.msg:001b:0x0000111A:00e0:8=Hey, which way did they go?
uid01160749.msg:0018:0x00001136:00ec:9=He took all my things...
uid01160749.msg:0033:0x0000114F:00f8:10=That guy again! I won't let him get away this time!
uid01160749.msg:0026:0x00001184:0110:11=*pant* *pant* I can't... keep going...
uid01160749.msg:003d:0x000011AB:011c:12=End of the line. I'll be taking that woman's belongings back.
uid01160749.msg:000a:0x000011E9:0128:13=Damn it...
uid01160749.msg:0023:0x000011F4:0134:14=I can't let myself get caught here!
uid01160749.msg:0013:0x0000121D:014c:15=Tch, he took off...
uid01160749.msg:0049:0x00001233:0170:16=Thank you so much! He stole my father's medicine. You've really saved me.
uid01160749.msg:004c:0x0000127D:017c:17=No need to thank me. Kyo has been more dangerous lately, so just be careful.
uid01160749.msg:0065:0x000012CA:0188:18=It's strange, though... From the way he was dressed, he must have been one of the Chivalrous Shinobi.
uid01160749.msg:0026:0x00001330:0194:19=The Chivalrous Shinobi? What are they?
uid01160749.msg:006c:0x00001357:01a0:20=They're a group of ninja who act as gentlemen thieves. Normally, they've been allies to us poor townspeople.
uid01160749.msg:008c:0x000013C4:01ac:21=I can't say this too loudly, but... They would steal from the wealthy who abused their power and redistribute their valuables to commonfolk!
uid01160749.msg:005b:0x00001451:01b8:22=But lately there have been rumors of shinobi going rogue and stealing from anyone they can!
uid01160749.msg:0051:0x000014AD:01c4:23=These Chivalrous Shinobi are starting to steal indiscriminately? That's not good.
uid01160749.msg:0044:0x000014FF:01d0:24=We're at a loss. All we could do was reach out to the Tachibanagumi.
uid01160749.msg:0027:0x00001544:01dc:25=So, that's where the request came from.
uid01160749.msg:003d:0x0000156C:01e8:26=But this time, you saved me—and my father! Thank you again!
uid01160749.msg:004c:0x000015AA:01f4:27=(Omatsu needs to hear about this. I should report back to Tachibanagumi HQ.)

uid0116075a.msg:000b:0x00000373:0094:2=This guy...
uid0116075a.msg:001e:0x0000037F:00a0:3=Who am I? What was I doing...?
uid0116075a.msg:0038:0x0000039E:00ac:4=He's practically delirious. I can't just leave him here.
uid01160763.msg:0006:0x00001238:0068:1=Thief!
uid01160763.msg:001b:0x00001240:0080:2=Hey, which way did they go?
uid01160763.msg:0009:0x0000125D:0098:3=That way!
uid01160763.msg:0030:0x00001267:00a4:4=Must be the ones from the Tachibanagumi request.
uid01160763.msg:0005:0x00001298:00b0:5=Stop!
uid01160763.msg:0010:0x0000129F:00c8:6=They got away...
uid01160763.msg:0031:0x000012B0:00d4:7=Maybe they'll turn up again if I come back later.
uid01160763.msg:0006:0x000012E2:00e0:8=Thief!
uid01160763.msg:001b:0x000012E9:00ec:9=Hey, which way did they go?
uid01160763.msg:0009:0x00001305:00f8:10=That way!
uid01160763.msg:004d:0x0000130F:0104:11=It's the ones from the request again. They won't get away this time. Hold it!
uid01160763.msg:0007:0x0000135F:0128:12=Crap...
uid01160763.msg:0022:0x00001367:0134:13=I'll take back what you stole now.
uid01160763.msg:0017:0x0000138A:0140:14=Damn! We're outta here!
uid01160763.msg:0044:0x000013A4:0164:15=Wait! Aren't you Chivalrous Shinobi supposed to steal from the rich?
uid01160763.msg:0004:0x000013E9:0170:16=Tch.
uid01160763.msg:0049:0x000013EE:017c:17=Why did you change? It sounds like you once did right by the people here.
uid01160763.msg:0029:0x00001438:0188:18=This doesn't involve you! Leave us alone!
uid01160763.msg:0028:0x00001462:0194:19=Someone like you could never understand!
uid01160763.msg:0021:0x0000148B:01a0:20=We've vowed to follow our leader.
uid01160763.msg:0048:0x000014AD:01ac:21=We're sorry for the townsfolk, we are. But... there's nothing we can do!
uid01160763.msg:001b:0x000014F7:01c4:22=I wonder what's going on...
uid01160763.msg:0028:0x00001515:01e8:23=Thank you so much! You're a good person!
uid01160763.msg:0062:0x0000153E:01f4:24=No need to thank me. But this isn't the first robbery I've had to stop, so be careful from now on.
uid01160763.msg:0015:0x000015A1:0200:25=Of course. Thank you!
uid01160763.msg:0046:0x000015B7:020c:26=(I should head back to Tachibanagumi HQ for now and report to Omatsu.)

uid01160781.msg:0028:0x00000576:0098:2=He was on the Tachibanagumi's request...
uid01160781.msg:0012:0x0000059F:00a4:3=And there he goes.
uid01160781.msg:0039:0x000005B2:00b0:4=He might still be around here. I should stay on my guard.
uid01160781.msg:0014:0x000005EF:00e0:5=What... happened...?
uid01160781.msg:001b:0x00000604:00ec:6=My head... It hurts... Ugh.
uid01160781.msg:0039:0x00000620:00f8:7=Not again. I should see if Omatsu can look over them too.

uid01160799.msg:0012:0x00000CB2:0068:4=Ah, all right. Hm?
uid01160799.msg:001e:0x00000CC7:008c:5=Damn, they found us! Get back.
uid01160799.msg:0039:0x00000CE8:00b0:6=Of course. Heheheh, I look forward to seeing your skills.
uid01160799.msg:003a:0x00000D26:00ec:7=Heheheh. You're everything they said you were. Impressive.
uid01160799.msg:0012:0x00000D61:00f8:8=Are you all right?
uid01160799.msg:0046:0x00000D74:0104:9=Thanks to you. I'll be on my way now. You've done everything I needed.

uid011607af.msg:003b:0x0000139C:008c:6=Omatsu was right. Something strange is definitely going on.
uid011607af.msg:0018:0x000013DD:00a4:7=Guess there's no choice.
uid011607af.msg:0007:0x000013F6:00b0:8=Aaah!!!
uid011607af.msg:0013:0x00001406:00d4:9=Ugh... Who are you?
uid011607af.msg:001d:0x0000141A:00e0:10=Are you with the Touken Clan?
uid011607af.msg:0065:0x00001438:00ec:11=My name's Saito. I've crossed swords with your members, but haven't had much luck speaking with them.
uid011607af.msg:0045:0x0000149E:00f8:12=It feels like... Ugh, it feels like I've been trapped in a nightmare.
uid011607af.msg:001e:0x000014E4:0104:13=Can you tell me what happened?
uid011607af.msg:0033:0x00001503:0110:14=It's hard to remember exactly. My head is so foggy.
uid011607af.msg:004c:0x00001537:011c:15=Forgive me. My name is Yukimitsu, I'm the representative of the Touken Clan.
uid011607af.msg:0053:0x00001584:0128:16=From what I can recall, it all started when I acquired the demonic sword, Murasama.
uid011607af.msg:0032:0x000015D8:0134:17=A demonic sword? That might explain some things...
uid011607af.msg:006f:0x0000160B:0140:18=The Touken Clan is home to many of various backgrounds, but we're all brothers united by a love of rare katana.
uid011607af.msg:0033:0x0000167B:014c:19=It happened that one day an odd peddler visited us.
uid011607af.msg:000a:0x000016AF:0158:20=A peddler?
uid011607af.msg:006f:0x000016BA:0164:21=He claimed to deal in unique and extraordinary weaponry, and so we welcomed him, though he was a bit... tawdry.
uid011607af.msg:0055:0x0000172A:0170:22=At his urging, I purchased Murasama. Other members of our clan bought swords as well.
uid011607af.msg:0059:0x00001780:017c:23=From that day on, everything became hazy... As though I've been walking about in a dream.
uid011607af.msg:0039:0x000017DA:0188:24=That merchant seems suspicious. Did he say anything else?
uid011607af.msg:001b:0x00001814:0194:25=It's so hard to remember...
uid011607af.msg:005a:0x00001830:01a0:26=I seem to recall... Yes, he offered us some incense. He claimed it helped prevent fatigue.
uid011607af.msg:0013:0x0000188B:01ac:27=Incense, huh? Hm...
uid011607af.msg:005b:0x0000189F:01b8:28=The Tachibanagumi should look into this. They can help you all if you'll come back with me.
uid011607af.msg:0012:0x000018FB:01c4:29=Thank you. Urgh...
uid011607af.msg:0058:0x0000190E:01d0:30=(A peddler, a demonic sword, and incense? I should report all this to Tachibanagumi HQ.)
uid011607bd.msg:0006:0x0000224C:0068:1=Thief!
uid011607bd.msg:001b:0x00002253:0074:2=Hey, which way did they go?
uid011607bd.msg:0009:0x0000226F:0080:3=That way!
uid011607bd.msg:0030:0x0000227A:0098:4=Must be the ones from the Tachibanagumi request.
uid011607bd.msg:0016:0x000022AB:00a4:5=Got it, you wait here!
uid011607bd.msg:001d:0x000022C3:00bc:6=Sorry, I couldn't catch them.
uid011607bd.msg:0036:0x000022E1:00c8:7=Are you all right, samurai? Don't worry, I'll be fine.
uid011607bd.msg:002a:0x00002318:00d4:8=Mm. I'll do what I can to track them down.
uid011607bd.msg:0035:0x00002343:00e0:9=(Maybe they'll turn up again if I come back later...)
uid011607bd.msg:0006:0x00002379:00ec:10=Thief!
uid011607bd.msg:001b:0x00002380:00f8:11=Hey, which way did they go?
uid011607bd.msg:0009:0x0000239C:0104:12=That way!
uid011607bd.msg:0044:0x000023A6:0110:13=It's the ones from the request again. They won't get away this time!
uid011607bd.msg:0028:0x000023EC:0128:14=Hey, all of you. Just wait for a second.
uid011607bd.msg:003e:0x0000241A:0140:15=What's going on? Aren't you supposed to be Chivalrous Shinobi?
uid011607bd.msg:001b:0x00002459:014c:16=What does it matter to you?
uid011607bd.msg:0047:0x00002475:0158:17=I'm with the Tachibanagumi. People have been asking us to stop you all.
uid011607bd.msg:007a:0x000024BD:0164:18=I should be trying to capture you and bring you to our headquarters, but something tells me you're not just petty thieves.
uid011607bd.msg:003e:0x00002538:0170:19=The Tachibanagumi, huh? They've been good to us in the past...
uid011607bd.msg:0024:0x00002577:017c:20=Then trust us now. What's happening?
uid011607bd.msg:002d:0x000025A3:0194:21=If there's anything I can do to help, I will.
uid011607bd.msg:001b:0x000025D1:01a0:22=All right, I'll tell you...
uid011607bd.msg:0059:0x000025ED:01ac:23=We did once call ourselves Chivalrous Shinobi. But our leader, Tojiro-sama, has gone mad.
uid011607bd.msg:0009:0x00002647:01b8:24=Gone mad?
uid011607bd.msg:0058:0x00002651:01c4:25=Yes. Tojiro-sama and his sister, Oharu-san, were abandoned as children. They're orphans.
uid011607bd.msg:004d:0x000026AA:01d0:26=Growing up in poverty, Tojiro-sama decided to apprentice with a shinobi clan.
uid011607bd.msg:007a:0x000026F8:01dc:27=After striking out on their own, Tojiro and Oharu began taking people who had nowhere else in. They're like parents to us.
uid011607bd.msg:0038:0x00002773:01e8:28=But our clan's mother, Oharu-san, fell ill not long ago.
uid011607bd.msg:006d:0x000027B3:0200:29=A doctor told us... all he could do was give her a little more time. And even that would require a hefty sum.
uid011607bd.msg:001f:0x00002821:020c:30=So, to pay for her treatment...
uid011607bd.msg:0058:0x00002841:0218:31=Yes. There was no way to amass that much money without renouncing our chivalrous values.
uid011607bd.msg:0049:0x0000289A:0224:32=Of course, we know that Oharu-san wouldn't want this. But, Tojiro-sama...
uid011607bd.msg:0018:0x000028E4:0230:33=Tojiro-sama has changed.
uid011607bd.msg:0079:0x000028FD:023c:34=These days he doesn't even talk to us. He just stays in his room, burning incense that lickspittle doctor prescribed him.
uid011607bd.msg:000b:0x00002977:0248:35=Incense...?
uid011607bd.msg:004e:0x00002983:0254:36=It's supposed to ease his suffering. Tojiro-sama must surely be in great pain.
uid011607bd.msg:0032:0x000029D9:026c:37=So, that's our story... I hope you understand now.
uid011607bd.msg:0032:0x00002A0C:0278:38=That said, we can't afford for you to bring us in.
uid011607bd.msg:0005:0x00002A3F:0284:39=Wait!
uid011607bd.msg:0004:0x00002A45:0290:40=Huh?
uid011607bd.msg:003a:0x00002A4A:029c:41=The incense you mentioned. What else do you know about it?
uid011607bd.msg:003e:0x00002A85:02a8:42=If you really want to help your leader, this might be the key.
uid011607bd.msg:004a:0x00002AC4:02b4:43=Can you tell me who this doctor is? The Tachibanagumi could look into him.
uid011607bd.msg:0031:0x00002B0F:02c0:44=Why would they do that? Do you suspect something?
uid011607bd.msg:0037:0x00002B41:02cc:45=It's possible that Tojiro is being manipulated somehow.
uid011607bd.msg:0006:0x00002B79:02d8:46=What!?
uid011607bd.msg:004d:0x00002B80:02e4:47=We uncovered a similar incident recently. It also involved a strange incense.
uid011607bd.msg:0041:0x00002BCE:02f0:48=I'm not sure, but it's possible the same person is behind it all.
uid011607bd.msg:0058:0x00002C10:02fc:49=It can't be... We've all been so concerned... We'll try to find out what we can for you!
uid011607bd.msg:0059:0x00002C69:0308:50=Thank you. Do you know where Tachibanagumi HQ is? If you discover anything, contact them.
uid011607bd.msg:0023:0x00002CC3:0314:51=Understood. I appreciate your help.
uid011607bd.msg:0023:0x00002CE7:0320:52=Oh, and please, return this for us.
uid011607bd.msg:0007:0x00002D0B:032c:53=I will.
uid011607bd.msg:0038:0x00002D16:035c:54=Thank you so much! I won't let it out of my sight again!
uid011607bd.msg:001c:0x00002D4F:0368:55=Good, take care. Be careful.
uid011607bd.msg:004a:0x00002D6D:0380:56=(I should head back to Tachibanagumi HQ. Omatsu needs to hear about this.)
uid011607d1.msg:0027:0x00000FBA:0090:1=(That's them—three from the request.)
uid011607d1.msg:0059:0x00000FE2:009c:2=Hey, you all. People have been complaining. You need to pay your bill and be on your way.
uid011607d1.msg:0016:0x0000103C:00a8:3=Who the hell are you!?
uid011607d1.msg:0021:0x00001053:00b4:4=Wait! You're the one from before!
uid011607d1.msg:0022:0x00001075:00c0:5=Because of you, our boss—he's...
uid011607d1.msg:0044:0x000010A0:00e4:6=Everyone up! I, Sagami of the diabolical Jozo Tengu, demand justice!
uid011607d1.msg:0021:0x000010E5:00f0:7=Fine. Whatever gets you to leave.
uid011607d1.msg:002c:0x00001107:00fc:8=You! Call over everyone from the other shop!
uid011607d1.msg:0007:0x00001134:0108:9=Yessir!
uid011607d1.msg:000e:0x00001141:0150:10=Let's get him!
uid011607d1.msg:0024:0x00001151:0168:11=*pant* Damn it, he's still too much!
uid011607d1.msg:0043:0x00001176:0174:12=How many times am I going to have to beat you all before you learn?
uid011607d1.msg:0066:0x000011BA:0180:13=Grrr! If you think our boss would ever lie down for the likes of you, you've got another thing coming!
uid011607d1.msg:0057:0x00001221:018c:14='Course, that was before he started to change... Ah, damn it. I guess I'll fill you in!
uid011607d1.msg:0086:0x00001279:0198:15=The boss met this new guy recently... At first, revenge on you was all he cared about, but lately I get the feeling he's being used...
uid011607d1.msg:0034:0x00001300:01a4:16=He won't tell us anything, though! It pisses me off!
uid011607d1.msg:001d:0x00001335:01b0:17=Just, watch out for yourself.
uid011607d1.msg:005d:0x00001353:01bc:18=(Something's happened to the leader of the tengu, Jozo? I should let Omatsu know about this.)
uid011607dd.msg:000f:0x00000E0C:0038:1=Are you Tojiro?
uid011607dd.msg:0007:0x00000E1C:0044:2=Urrr...
uid011607dd.msg:000f:0x00000E24:0050:3=Who is this...?
uid011607dd.msg:0068:0x00000E34:005c:4=Your fellow shinobi are worried about you. I'd like you to step away from that incense and come outside.
uid011607dd.msg:0005:0x00000E9E:0074:5=Urgh!
uid011607dd.msg:0058:0x00000EA6:0098:6=Without this incense, Oharu will wither and die! Are you trying to take my sister away!?
uid011607dd.msg:002b:0x00000EFF:00a4:7=Tch, it's no use trying to reason with him.
uid011607dd.msg:0035:0x00000F2E:00d4:8=Green Ninja, find Oharu! Take her into the fresh air!
uid011607dd.msg:000b:0x00000F64:00e0:9=Right away!
uid011607dd.msg:0019:0x00000F77:0110:10=I can't let you stop him.
uid011607dd.msg:000a:0x00000F91:011c:11=Aaaaagh!!!
uid011607dd.msg:0008:0x00000F9D:0134:12=Brother!
uid011607dd.msg:001f:0x00000FA6:0140:13=Oharu! You're... on your feet!?
uid011607dd.msg:001b:0x00000FC6:014c:14=I am! So please, stop this.
uid011607dd.msg:0046:0x00000FE2:0158:15=Tojiro-sama, you must come to your senses! It's that doctor's incense!
uid011607dd.msg:0010:0x00001029:0164:16=Urgh... My head!
uid011607dd.msg:0008:0x0000103A:0170:17=Brother!
uid011607dd.msg:000c:0x00001043:017c:18=Tojiro-sama!
uid011607dd.msg:0046:0x00001050:0188:19=We'll take all of you back to Tachibanagumi HQ, where you can recover.
uid011607dd.msg:0006:0x00001097:0194:20=Right!
uid011607f3.msg:0007:0x000011EE:0060:1=Hahaha!
uid011607f3.msg:0023:0x000011F6:006c:2=What the hell are all of you doing?
uid011607f3.msg:0032:0x0000121B:0084:3=Look at it... Look at the strength we've obtained!
uid011607f3.msg:0035:0x0000124E:0090:4=And it was all worth it—to finally <i>kill</i> you!
uid011607f3.msg:0028:0x00001284:009c:5=That's right. All worth it... to kill...
uid011607f3.msg:001b:0x000012AD:00a8:6=Tch. I see what's going on.
uid011607f3.msg:0007:0x000012C9:00b4:7=Kill!!!
uid011607f3.msg:0006:0x000012D2:00cc:8=Ugh...
uid011607f3.msg:0012:0x000012D9:00d8:9=I feel... awful...
uid011607f3.msg:0010:0x000012EC:00e4:10=Can we talk now?
uid011607f3.msg:0008:0x000012FD:00f0:11=Sorry...
uid011607f3.msg:000b:0x00001306:00fc:12=The boss...
uid011607f3.msg:0014:0x00001312:0108:13=He's gone all crazy.
uid011607f3.msg:000e:0x00001327:0114:14=You mean Jozo?
uid011607f3.msg:004f:0x00001336:0120:15=Yeah. After losing to you, we all started brainstorming how to get our revenge.
uid011607f3.msg:0047:0x00001386:012c:16=That's when <i>he</i> showed up... That toady bastard with his incense.
uid011607f3.msg:003d:0x000013CE:0138:17=I knew it was a bad idea. Guy was fishy right from the start.
uid011607f3.msg:0049:0x0000140C:0144:18=But the boss, he went along with it. Said we should do whatever it takes.
uid011607f3.msg:0017:0x00001456:0150:19=So, that's how it went.
uid011607f3.msg:003d:0x0000146E:015c:20=Lately, he's even been beating on us, just to test his power.
uid011607f3.msg:002d:0x000014AC:0168:21=You... You're the only one that can help him.
uid011607f3.msg:002a:0x000014DA:0174:22=After all this, you're still loyal to him?
uid011607f3.msg:006d:0x00001505:0180:23=At first, we only joined the tengu because we admired his strength. But, we've been allies for so long now...
uid011607f3.msg:003a:0x00001573:018c:24=Haha... yeah. No matter what happens, he's still our boss.
uid011607f3.msg:0039:0x000015AE:0198:25=It hurts having to ask, but please, help us get him back.
uid011607f3.msg:0054:0x000015E8:01a4:26=Hm. I guess he was pretty inspiring, after all. Fine, if he wants me, I'll find him.
uid011607f3.msg:0031:0x0000163D:01b0:27=You should all head to Tachibanagumi HQ and rest.
uid011607f3.msg:0010:0x0000166F:01bc:28=We will. Thanks.
uid011607f5.msg:0006:0x00000F89:0074:1=Thief!
uid011607f5.msg:001b:0x00000F90:0080:2=Hey, which way did they go?
uid011607f5.msg:0009:0x00000FAC:008c:3=That way!
uid011607f5.msg:0016:0x00000FB6:0098:4=Another ninja? Damn...
uid011607f5.msg:000e:0x00000FCE:00b0:5=He got away...
uid011607f5.msg:002f:0x00000FDD:00bc:6=Maybe he'll turn up again if I come back later.
uid011607f5.msg:0006:0x0000100D:00c8:7=Thief!
uid011607f5.msg:001b:0x00001014:00d4:8=Hey, which way did they go?
uid011607f5.msg:0009:0x00001030:00e0:9=That way!
uid011607f5.msg:002e:0x0000103A:00ec:10=Him again! I won't let him get away this time!
uid011607f5.msg:0051:0x0000106A:0104:11=Hey! Aren't you with the Chivalrous Shinobi? Why are you still robbing townsfolk?
uid011607f5.msg:0012:0x000010BC:0110:12=I need... money...
uid011607f5.msg:0006:0x000010CF:011c:13=Ugh...
uid011607f5.msg:0005:0x000010D7:0134:14=Stop!
uid011607f5.msg:0012:0x000010DD:0140:15=Damn, he got away.
uid011607f5.msg:000a:0x000010F0:014c:16=Saito-san!
uid011607f5.msg:0025:0x000010FB:0158:17=Did I just see you chasing Red Ninja?
uid011607f5.msg:0011:0x00001121:0164:18=Is he one of you?
uid011607f5.msg:002c:0x00001133:0170:19=Yes, but he's been missing for several days.
uid011607f5.msg:0045:0x00001160:017c:20=I see. Well, I happened to catch him stealing from an innocent woman.
uid011607f5.msg:002b:0x000011A6:0188:21=Why, Red? You were the fastest of us all...
uid011607f5.msg:005d:0x000011D2:0194:22=I tried talking to him, but he wasn't listening. He was in the same state we found Tojiro in.
uid011607f5.msg:003a:0x00001230:01a0:23=Damn. I'll look into this on our end and contact you soon.
uid011607f5.msg:000a:0x0000126B:01ac:24=All right.
uid011607f5.msg:0011:0x00001276:01b8:25=Farewell for now.
uid011607ff.msg:0021:0x000008BC:0068:1=Owww... What was I even doing...?
uid011607ff.msg:000a:0x000008DE:0074:2=My head...
uid011607ff.msg:0019:0x000008E9:0080:3=Are you able to talk now?
uid011607ff.msg:0006:0x00000903:008c:4=You...
uid011607ff.msg:000c:0x0000090A:0098:5=Who are you?
uid011607ff.msg:0019:0x00000917:00a4:6=How much do you remember?
uid011607ff.msg:0052:0x00000931:00b0:7=A man in a tengu mask forced me to inhale something... It's all a blur after that.
uid011607ff.msg:000a:0x00000984:00bc:8=A tengu...
uid011607ff.msg:0014:0x0000098F:00c8:9=My head is spinning.
uid011607ff.msg:0030:0x000009A4:00d4:10=Get yourselves to Tachibanagumi HQ in Mukurogai.
uid011607ff.msg:0018:0x000009D5:00e0:11=They'll know what to do.
uid011607ff.msg:000d:0x000009EE:00ec:12=Ah... Got it.
uid011607ff.msg:0056:0x000009FF:011c:13=(More ronin and street thugs getting roped into all this. What the hell is happening?)
uid01160823.msg:0015:0x00001E22:00d0:1=There you are, Saito!
uid01160823.msg:0018:0x00001E38:00dc:2=Yeah. It's been a while.
uid01160823.msg:005b:0x00001E51:00e8:3=The taste of crap you left in my mouth that day... I'll never rest until I have my revenge!
uid01160823.msg:002a:0x00001EAD:00f4:4=So, are you the one behind all this, Jozo?
uid01160823.msg:004d:0x00001ED8:0100:5=That's right! Me, and my underlings you see behind me. Even Red Ninja here...
uid01160823.msg:0006:0x00001F26:010c:6=Ugh...
uid01160823.msg:005b:0x00001F2D:0118:7=Tch! Principled little bastard that he is. But he's the only one not in my complete thrall!
uid01160823.msg:002b:0x00001F89:0124:8=What exactly have you done to these people?
uid01160823.msg:005e:0x00001FB5:0130:9=This is my greatest power! As long as I have that incense, I can make anyone my loyal servant.
uid01160823.msg:0078:0x00002014:013c:10=Not only that, but if they're hypnotized into believing they're strong, they'll attack with incredible ferocity! Hahaha!
uid01160823.msg:0047:0x0000208D:0148:11=All of this, Saito... I've done all of this, just to get even with you!
uid01160823.msg:0032:0x000020D5:0154:12=Haha! I'll raise your severed head in glory today!
uid01160823.msg:0059:0x00002108:0160:13=Pathetic. Power like that, and all you could think of was revenge on me? You're hopeless.
uid01160823.msg:0051:0x00002162:016c:14=Shut up, shut up, shut up! It doesn't matter what you say, I'm going to beat you!
uid01160823.msg:0018:0x000021B4:0178:15=Everyone... destroy him!
uid01160823.msg:000d:0x000021CF:019c:16=Why... Why...
uid01160823.msg:0004:0x000021DD:01a8:17=Agh!
uid01160823.msg:000e:0x000021E2:01b4:18=Where... am I?
uid01160823.msg:0007:0x000021F1:01c0:19=Urgh...
uid01160823.msg:000f:0x000021F9:01cc:20=Grr, my body...
uid01160823.msg:0018:0x00002209:01d8:21=Red Ninja! Are you okay?
uid01160823.msg:0040:0x00002222:01e4:22=You've all been put under some strange spell by your boss, Jozo.
uid01160823.msg:0011:0x00002263:01f0:23=What do you mean?
uid01160823.msg:0026:0x00002275:01fc:24=No way... What did you do to us, boss?
uid01160823.msg:001b:0x0000229C:0208:25=Jozo... How dare you! Urgh!
uid01160823.msg:002b:0x000022B8:0214:26=Red Ninja, don't worry. We'll get you help.
uid01160823.msg:001f:0x000022E5:022c:27=Villain! How dare you do this!?
uid01160823.msg:0025:0x00002305:0238:28=Eep! It—It's not my fault, I swear!
uid01160823.msg:0017:0x0000232B:0244:29=Wait! What do you mean?
uid01160823.msg:0026:0x00002343:0250:30=It was that guy... He put me up to it.
uid01160823.msg:0024:0x0000236A:025c:31=What guy? Who are you talking about?
uid01160823.msg:0037:0x0000238F:0268:32=He came to us just after we ran away from you that day.
uid01160823.msg:003a:0x000023C7:0274:33=We were trying to think of how we could get back at you...
uid01160823.msg:0040:0x00002402:0280:34=He said if I used his incense, everything would fall into place.
uid01160823.msg:007c:0x00002443:028c:35=If someone came to you at your lowest moment in life and offered you a deal like that, you'd agree to it too, wouldn't you!?
uid01160823.msg:0028:0x000024C7:02a4:36=So, you see? It's not really my fault...
uid01160823.msg:003a:0x000024F0:02b0:37=You've caused so much trouble for the people in this city.
uid01160823.msg:000b:0x0000252B:02bc:38=Damn idiot.
uid01160823.msg:0048:0x00002537:02c8:39=Eh!? Look, I'll tell you everything! I'll spill it all, just forgive me!
uid01160823.msg:0019:0x00002580:02d4:40=Who gave you the incense?
uid01160823.msg:003f:0x0000259A:02e0:41=He was dressed like a merchant. Had a real son-of-a-bitch face.
uid01160823.msg:003a:0x000025DA:02ec:42=I don't know much else about him. We only met a few times.
uid01160823.msg:0015:0x00002615:02f8:43=Where can I find him?
uid01160823.msg:005d:0x0000262B:0304:44=He's probably by the river in Rakugai. He said something about executing his plan from there.
uid01160823.msg:0014:0x00002689:0310:45=His plan? What plan?
uid01160823.msg:0019:0x0000269E:031c:46=I don't know the details!
uid01160823.msg:0025:0x000026B8:0328:47=Just, please, forgive me, all right!?
uid01160823.msg:0037:0x000026DE:0334:48=Whatever. All of you, come with me to Tachibanagumi HQ.
uid01160831.msg:0007:0x00002391:0054:1=Omatsu!
uid01160831.msg:0029:0x00002399:0060:2=You're much too late. She's already mine.
uid01160831.msg:0045:0x000023C3:006c:3=You? Aren't you Omatsu's friend? The one she's known since childhood?
uid01160831.msg:0039:0x00002409:0078:4=Ah, you remember me. Such an excellent escort, Saito-san.
uid01160831.msg:0063:0x00002443:0084:5=Again and again you've thwarted my plans. It doesn't matter anymore, though! Now that I have her...
uid01160831.msg:002b:0x000024A7:0090:6=Omatsu! Who do you love most in this world?
uid01160831.msg:0017:0x000024D3:009c:7=You, Akumi... Always...
uid01160831.msg:0036:0x000024EC:00b4:8=Hear that!? Haha! It works. My experiment is complete.
uid01160831.msg:000b:0x00002523:00c0:9=Experiment?
uid01160831.msg:0085:0x0000252F:00cc:10=That's right! I've known Omatsu all my life. I've never wanted anyone else but her! But, when I finally got the courage to propose...
uid01160831.msg:0018:0x000025B5:00d8:11=She turned me down cold!
uid01160831.msg:0073:0x000025CE:00e4:12=Even after all the times we had tea together! Even after that moment our hands touched reaching for the same dango!
uid01160831.msg:0037:0x00002642:00f0:13=I had to... I had to obtain this power, for <i>her</i>.
uid01160831.msg:006c:0x00002681:0108:14=Of course, test subjects were necessary. Imagine if I'd made my incense too powerful and broke her entirely.
uid01160831.msg:0021:0x000026EE:0114:15=So, all of it—it was all for...
uid01160831.msg:007d:0x00002710:0120:16=Omatsu is surprisingly strong-willed. I had to wear her down bit by bit, putting more and more pressure on the Tachibanagumi.
uid01160831.msg:006a:0x0000278E:012c:17=Your antagonism was quite useful, in fact. Here, I've prepared a reward for you, to show you my gratitude.
uid01160831.msg:0052:0x000027FA:0144:18=You really are annoying. I can see now why everyone told me you were such a creep.
uid01160831.msg:006a:0x0000284D:0150:19=You see other people as things you can use, but so far, you've underestimated everyone you've come across.
uid01160831.msg:000d:0x000028B8:015c:20=Including me.
uid01160831.msg:005d:0x000028C6:0168:21=Heheheh. Your grandstanding is truly succulent. I'll savor the memory of it once you're dead.
uid01160831.msg:0069:0x00002924:0174:22=These men are more effectively brainwashed than any you've yet faced. Witness the full extent of my will!
uid01160831.msg:0005:0x00002990:0198:23=No...
uid01160831.msg:0025:0x00002996:01a4:24=You were all talk. No surprise there.
uid01160831.msg:002d:0x000029BC:01b0:25=It can't end like this... Why didn't it work?
uid01160831.msg:0067:0x000029EA:01bc:26=People need a leader who inspires them. When they hold their swords, they need passion in their hearts.
uid01160831.msg:002a:0x00002A52:01c8:27=Just like a woman... when she holds a man.
uid01160831.msg:0017:0x00002A7E:01e0:28=Open your eyes already!
uid01160831.msg:0054:0x00002A97:01f8:29=After everything you've done—all the trouble you caused—you still don't get it!?
uid01160831.msg:004d:0x00002AF3:0210:30=I've always known how you felt about me. Honestly, you hardly kept it secret.
uid01160831.msg:0057:0x00002B41:021c:31=But ever since we were kids, you've been like this. You're selfish, and you use people!
uid01160831.msg:0009:0x00002B99:0228:32=Omatsu...
uid01160831.msg:0028:0x00002BA3:0234:33=Who could ever love a coward like that!?
uid01160831.msg:0061:0x00002BCC:0240:34=I told you once before—not in a hundred years would I go out with you! Clean up your whole act!
uid01160831.msg:002e:0x00002C2E:024c:35=Grrr... You—You haven't seen the last of me!
uid01160831.msg:0004:0x00002C5D:0258:36=Now!
uid01160831.msg:0006:0x00002C62:0264:37=Gah!!!
uid01160831.msg:0050:0x00002C6A:027c:38=You're not going anywhere. Not before you atone for the crimes you've committed.
uid01160831.msg:0044:0x00002CBB:0288:39=Omatsu, you're really all right? I thought you were under his spell.
uid01160831.msg:0027:0x00002D00:0294:40=I'm fine! He never had me for a moment.
uid01160831.msg:0004:0x00002D28:02a0:41=Huh?
uid01160831.msg:0053:0x00002D2D:02ac:42=Well, as long as you don't breathe in his incense too deeply, it's not that strong.
uid01160831.msg:006b:0x00002D81:02b8:43=It can make you a little more suggestible, but you can overcome it if you stay alert and keep a clear head.
uid01160831.msg:008a:0x00002DED:02c4:44=Unfortunately, the Touken Clan was drawn in by their curiosity for rare swords, and the Chivalrous Shinobi were distraught over Oharu-san.
uid01160831.msg:0065:0x00002E78:02d0:45=Akumi thought that he'd weakened my resolve like he did theirs, but he couldn't have been more wrong!
uid01160831.msg:0029:0x00002EDE:02dc:46=Hm. I guess I shouldn't have doubted you.
uid01160831.msg:004e:0x00002F08:02e8:47=Actually, I had an inkling Akumi might have had something to do with all this.
uid01160831.msg:0062:0x00002F57:02f4:48=But when I tried getting any information out of him, he was very careful not to let anything slip.
uid01160831.msg:006e:0x00002FBA:0300:49=So, I decided that I had to put on an act to get him to drop his guard. It was a request only I could fulfill!
uid01160831.msg:0027:0x00003029:030c:50=I see. You certainly had me fooled too.
uid01160831.msg:006a:0x00003051:0318:51=Heehee. Let that be a lesson to you too, then! Now, let's get everyone back to Tachibanagumi HQ, shall we?
uid0116084d.msg:002c:0x00003128:0068:1=Oi, look at that. Fancy sword you got there.
uid0116084d.msg:004f:0x00003155:0074:2=Pricey ones are usually shit in a fight, but that looks like it might be sharp.
uid0116084d.msg:0027:0x000031A5:0080:3=Yeah, asshole, we're talking about you!
uid0116084d.msg:0059:0x000031CD:008c:4=How about you hand over that katana before I give you mine? Straight to the gut, that is!
uid0116084d.msg:0051:0x00003228:00a4:5=Dying on an empty street, pissing your fundoshi's no way to end your life, is it?
uid0116084d.msg:003b:0x0000327A:00b0:6=You three are almost too tiresome to be worth dealing with.
uid0116084d.msg:0039:0x000032B6:00bc:7=Enough of the braggadocio. You wouldn't want to get hurt.
uid0116084d.msg:003c:0x000032F0:00c8:8=Huh? Who are you? He's gonna get dead, buddy, not just hurt!
uid0116084d.msg:0019:0x0000332D:00d4:9=No. I meant you, not him.
uid0116084d.msg:0005:0x00003347:00e0:10=Huh!?
uid0116084d.msg:0071:0x0000334D:00ec:11=If you boys want to play with your swords, do it elsewhere. The sight of you is dirtying my dojo's fine exterior.
uid0116084d.msg:001d:0x000033BF:00f8:12=Dojo? Wait, does that mean...
uid0116084d.msg:0028:0x000033DD:0104:13=Y-You run this place? Swordsman Ginryu!?
uid0116084d.msg:0072:0x00003406:0110:14=Indeed, I am Ginryu. And you won't get another word from me unless you're willing to lay down your life in combat.
uid0116084d.msg:0021:0x00003479:011c:15=Oi, this guy's bad news, I heard.
uid0116084d.msg:003b:0x0000349C:0134:16=Shit! We'll leave—but you! I won't forget your face, pal!
uid0116084d.msg:002e:0x000034DA:0158:17=Haha. And so the wind carries off our rubbish.
uid0116084d.msg:005d:0x00003509:0164:18=And to think, those ronin will not even spare me some gratitude for saving their lives today.
uid0116084d.msg:000c:0x00003567:0170:19=Who are you?
uid0116084d.msg:0060:0x00003574:017c:20=As you must have heard, my name is Ginryu. I offer instruction in the art of swordsmanship here.
uid0116084d.msg:0025:0x000035D5:0188:21=A pleasure to make your acquaintance.
uid0116084d.msg:0032:0x000035FB:0194:22=By the by... you are no ordinary samurai, are you?
uid0116084d.msg:0074:0x00003635:01ac:23=Whispers have found my ears recently... Telling of a man who's been ridding our city of rogues with ease and aplomb.
uid0116084d.msg:0058:0x000036AA:01b8:24=What most piques my curiosity, however, is what sort of blade a man like that must wear.
uid0116084d.msg:0012:0x00003703:01c4:25=Rumors get around.
uid0116084d.msg:007c:0x00003716:01d0:26=Yet nothing is more valuable than information. Only troubles await the man who does not listen to what he hears, these days.
uid0116084d.msg:005e:0x00003793:01dc:27=Those ronin seemed to have heard of you. I guess you're skilled enough for word to spread too.
uid0116084d.msg:0055:0x000037F2:01e8:28=Not at all. I am still an amateur—every day I learn much and more from my students.
uid0116084d.msg:006e:0x00003848:01f4:29=I ascribe to but one philosophy, myself. I believe that fighting should be beautiful, physically and mentally.
uid0116084d.msg:0047:0x000038B7:0200:30=Beautiful, huh? That seems like a difficult luxury to afford in combat.
uid0116084d.msg:007c:0x000038FF:020c:31=An understandable perspective from a man of your talent. However, can you deny the inherent artistry that exists in a blade?
uid0116084d.msg:006d:0x0000397C:0218:32=Perhaps you might grace us with your presence at the dojo? It never hurts to freshen one's training, does it?
uid0116084d.msg:0063:0x000039EC:023c:33=(Hm. Beauty in a fight? The artistry of swords? Maybe I should stop by his school once in a while.)
uid0116084d.msg:003f:0x00003A53:026c:34=Saito-san! We've been watching your lessons with Ginryu-sensei!
uid0116084d.msg:0048:0x00003A93:0278:35=There's something we'd like to discuss with you. May we speak somewhere?
uid0116084d.msg:001f:0x00003ADC:0284:36=Hm? Sure, I don't mind talking.
uid0116084d.msg:0019:0x00003AFC:0290:37=Thanks. Please, this way.
uid0116084d.msg:0065:0x00003B18:02b4:38=I hope you'll forgive us for dragging you all this way. We wanted to talk to you about Heinosuke-san.
uid0116084d.msg:0041:0x00003B7E:02c0:39=Ginryu's pupil? He made it sound like the dojo is relying on him.
uid0116084d.msg:0028:0x00003BC0:02cc:40=Is it true that he's Ginryu's successor?
uid0116084d.msg:003b:0x00003BE9:02d8:41=Things are a bit more complicated than that, unfortunately.
uid0116084d.msg:003d:0x00003C25:02e4:42=Just between us... Master Ginryu is a member of the nobility.
uid0116084d.msg:0014:0x00003C63:02f0:43=What? He's highborn?
uid0116084d.msg:0077:0x00003C78:02fc:44=That's right. Ginryu-sensei is very skilled, but men of his status don't have the luxury of running schools and things.
uid0116084d.msg:004c:0x00003CF0:0308:45=Hmm... He has an aristocratic way of speaking, but I never would've guessed.
uid0116084d.msg:007f:0x00003D3D:0314:46=Apparently, when he was a child, Master Ginryu discovered a knack for swordplay and kept at it. Eventually, he opened his dojo.
uid0116084d.msg:0066:0x00003DBD:0320:47=His parents gave him a certain amount of freedom, but he's their firstborn son. He has to return home.
uid0116084d.msg:0063:0x00003E24:032c:48=I guess you can't keep a dojo in Kyo open if you're the heir to land somewhere else in the country.
uid0116084d.msg:0072:0x00003E88:0338:49=Ginryu-sensei doesn't want his techniques to die out. He begged his family, and they allowed him three more years.
uid0116084d.msg:0023:0x00003EFB:0344:50=But... that was over two years ago.
uid0116084d.msg:0034:0x00003F1F:0350:51=I see. That's why Heinosuke said time's running out.
uid0116084d.msg:0055:0x00003F54:035c:52=All of us students agree with Master Ginryu, Heinosuke-san should take over the dojo.
uid0116084d.msg:0055:0x00003FAA:0368:53=However, unless he starts believing in himself and improves, he'll never be ready to.
uid0116084d.msg:0033:0x00004000:0374:54=We owe Ginryu-san so much. We all want to help him.
uid0116084d.msg:006f:0x00004034:0380:55=That's right. He took in poor samurai like me and taught us for nothing. He even made sure we have food to eat.
uid0116084d.msg:005d:0x000040A4:038c:56=I thought there was no such thing as a noble with a sense of charity. Sensei changed my life.
uid0116084d.msg:0054:0x00004102:0398:57=Please, sir! We need you. You have to be the one to carry on Ginryu-sensei's school!
uid0116084d.msg:0059:0x0000415E:03b0:58=It's a shame to abandon Heinosuke-san, but we simply don't have the time to wait for him.
uid0116084d.msg:0064:0x000041B8:03bc:59=If you took over the dojo, you could ensure that sensei's techniques live on! Won't you consider it?
uid0116084d.msg:001e:0x0000421D:03c8:60=All of you are fine with this?
uid0116084d.msg:0004:0x0000423C:03d4:61=Huh?
uid0116084d.msg:004a:0x00004241:03e0:62=You've been comrades for years. I'm practically a stranger, by comparison.
uid0116084d.msg:0040:0x0000428C:03ec:63=And Heinosuke is clearly trying his best to do right by you all.
uid0116084d.msg:004d:0x000042CD:03f8:64=If his fellow students are willing to give up on him, what hope does he have?
uid0116084d.msg:003e:0x00004322:0410:65=But, all right. If it's what you all want, I'll take the dojo.
uid0116084d.msg:006c:0x00004361:041c:66=I haven't got much free time, though. It'd be more convenient for me to kick you all out and sell the place.
uid0116084d.msg:0029:0x000043CE:0428:67=S-Sir! I had no idea you were so callous!
uid0116084d.msg:0057:0x000043F8:0434:68=You're naive. If you want to keep your dojo open, you already know what you have to do.
uid0116084d.msg:0022:0x00004450:0440:69=Grgh, fine. We're done here, then.
uid0116084d.msg:0075:0x00004476:0470:70=(That might've been harsh, but I think it was what they needed to hear. I should see what they and Heinosuke do now.)

uid0116086d.msg:0005:0x00000392:0040:2=Aaah!
uid0116086d.msg:0059:0x00000398:004c:3=I refuse to believe I raised such a coward! Begone from here! Never again enter my sight!

uid01160870.msg:0026:0x0000227E:0068:2=Lummox! I told you never to come back!
uid01160870.msg:000e:0x000022A5:0074:3=B-But, sensei!
uid01160870.msg:0054:0x000022B4:0080:4=Sensei shmensei! You have no right to call me by that name! Leave my dojo and— Hm?
uid01160870.msg:000c:0x0000230A:0098:5=Who is that?
uid01160870.msg:0038:0x00002317:00a4:6=This man shares the concerns I have! His name's... um...
uid01160870.msg:000d:0x00002350:00b0:7=Saito Hajime.
uid01160870.msg:0052:0x0000235E:00bc:8=Saito-san—right, of course! And, well, he's come for a noble purpose, you see...
uid01160870.msg:0036:0x000023B1:00c8:9=I was just passing by. This doesn't really involve me.
uid01160870.msg:0056:0x000023E8:00d4:10=Yes, um, he's uninvolved! He's got nothing at all to do with any of this! Wait, what!?
uid01160870.msg:003e:0x0000243F:00e0:11=Dimwit! Now you're just dragging in outsiders off the street!?
uid01160870.msg:0026:0x0000247E:00ec:12=Th—That wasn't what I meant to do...
uid01160870.msg:003c:0x000024A5:00f8:13=Saito-san, yes? Forgive my feckless and misbegotten student.
uid01160870.msg:005c:0x000024E2:0104:14=My name is Komaki Munemitsu. I am the heir to the Komaki style, and the master of this dojo.
uid01160870.msg:0032:0x0000253F:0110:15=I didn't even know there was a dojo down this way.
uid01160870.msg:005f:0x00002572:011c:16=See, sensei!? How many times have I told you that we need to advertise ourselves to the public?
uid01160870.msg:0028:0x000025D2:0128:17=Silence, unruly child! Now, Saito-san...
uid01160870.msg:002f:0x000025FB:0134:18=You're a man of significant skill, are you not?
uid01160870.msg:0010:0x0000262B:0140:19=Hm. Hard to say.
uid01160870.msg:0084:0x0000263C:014c:20=I can sense just from looking at you that you're proficient with your sword—and you've great potential for other styles of combat.
uid01160870.msg:0062:0x000026C8:0164:21=Let us make the most of your arrival, then. Saito-san, I would like you to battle my student here.
uid01160870.msg:0004:0x0000272B:0170:22=Eh!?
uid01160870.msg:0074:0x00002730:017c:23=And since you are so eager to incorporate armaments into the Komaki style, I shall permit you to use a wooden sword.
uid01160870.msg:0034:0x000027A5:0188:24=Saito-san, however, I wish to see fight emptyhanded.
uid01160870.msg:0013:0x000027DA:0194:25=I don't understand!
uid01160870.msg:0030:0x000027EE:01a0:26=Hm. I see what you're planning, old man. Clever.
uid01160870.msg:002e:0x0000281F:01ac:27=Whaaat? Somebody fill <i>me</i> in, would you?
uid01160870.msg:007b:0x0000284E:01b8:28=I've come this far—I don't mind having a match with you. Maybe this will help you understand your sensei's point-of-view.
uid01160870.msg:0033:0x000028CA:01c4:29=Heh. I knew I was right about this one. Now, begin!
uid01160870.msg:0046:0x000028FF:01dc:30=Wha... What the hell!? I thought you were just a swordsman, Saito-san!
uid01160870.msg:0063:0x00002946:01e8:31=True strength has nothing to do with the weapon one wields. Great artists can paint with any brush.
uid01160870.msg:0041:0x000029AA:01f4:32=I understand your frustrations, but you're overlooking something.
uid01160870.msg:0055:0x000029EC:0200:33=This old man probably has more than enough skill with a sword to take on any samurai.
uid01160870.msg:0019:0x00002A42:020c:34=Eh? Is that true, sensei?
uid01160870.msg:0065:0x00002A5C:0218:35=So then, the fact that he chooses to devote himself to barehanded martial arts means a hell of a lot.
uid01160870.msg:0039:0x00002AC2:0224:36=I think he wanted you to understand that, as his student.
uid01160870.msg:0038:0x00002AFC:0230:37=Say no more. Your words fall on deaf ears with this one.
uid01160870.msg:003e:0x00002B35:023c:38=I... I think I made a mistake, sensei. Have I embarrassed you?
uid01160870.msg:006e:0x00002B74:0248:39=If you're starting to question yourself, then get back to your training. Every answer you need is right there!
uid01160870.msg:000e:0x00002BE3:0254:40=Y-Yes, sensei!
uid01160870.msg:0037:0x00002BF2:0260:41=I apologize for all this trouble, Saito-san. Thank you.
uid01160870.msg:0032:0x00002C2A:026c:42=It's no problem. I just happened to be passing by.
uid01160870.msg:0072:0x00002C5D:0278:43=As you can see, all I have to my name is this humble dojo. There's little I can offer you in return for your help.
uid01160870.msg:006e:0x00002CD0:0284:44=Hm. Although, if you were so inclined to return, I could likely teach you some techniques of the Komaki style.
uid01160870.msg:0064:0x00002D3F:0290:45=You'd do that, even though I'm not one of your pupils? I wouldn't take a gift like that for granted.
uid01160870.msg:0077:0x00002DA4:029c:46=It would shame me to let talent like yours go unsculpted. And... you could even watch over my sad little student there.
uid01160870.msg:002b:0x00002E1C:02a8:47=Sounds good. I'll come by when I have time.
uid01160870.msg:0015:0x00002E48:02b4:48=Superb. I'll be here.
uid01160874.msg:0026:0x00003F99:0094:1=I had an inkling you would come today.
uid01160874.msg:005a:0x00003FC0:00a0:2=Like you said, brushing up one's skills can't hurt. I'm interested in what you teach here.
uid01160874.msg:0077:0x0000401B:00ac:3=And I am oh-so-interested in viewing your ability for myself. My students will also find this quite edifying, I'm sure.
uid01160874.msg:0049:0x00004093:00b8:4=Allow me to first ask... What style of fighting do you favor, personally?
uid01160874.msg:0073:0x000040DD:00c4:5=I mostly rely on my sword, but I have a sidearm too. When the situation calls for it, I sometimes use both at once.
uid01160874.msg:0039:0x00004151:00d0:6=Oh my. I am most curious to see what that must look like.
uid01160874.msg:0081:0x0000418B:00dc:7=Forgive my hastiness, but would you mind sparring with some of my apprentices? There would be no better way to inspect your form.
uid01160874.msg:0074:0x0000420D:00e8:8=If you would, engage them using only your sword, to begin with. When I signal you, incorporate your firearm as well.
uid01160874.msg:0011:0x00004282:00f4:9=Sure. No problem.
uid01160874.msg:0029:0x00004294:0100:10=Everyone, step back and ready yourselves.
uid01160874.msg:002c:0x000042BE:010c:11=Yes, master! Please, sir, hold nothing back!
uid01160874.msg:0012:0x000042EB:0118:12=Now, have at them!
uid01160874.msg:0029:0x000042FF:0130:13=Beautiful! Absolutely, utterly beautiful!
uid01160874.msg:008b:0x00004329:013c:14=Splendid Skill: Morning Mist has been unlocked. You can learn it by inserting a Soul Orb into the corresponding slot in the Abilities menu.

uid01160874.msg:003d:0x00004456:0160:17=Th—Thank you very much, sir! A supremely enlightening pain!
uid01160874.msg:0047:0x00004494:016c:18=You guys are pretty good. I can tell your training has been beneficial.
uid01160874.msg:0062:0x000044DC:0178:19=They are quite diligent. Though they're still coarse in places, each one shows tremendous promise.
uid01160874.msg:0078:0x0000453F:0184:20=And yet, your strength is even more impressive than I had imagined. Your technique is studied, though it lacks elegance.
uid01160874.msg:0082:0x000045B8:0190:21=I welcome you to train here further, whenever you care to. With time, you may come to embody my vision of a truly beautiful sword.
uid01160874.msg:0048:0x0000463B:019c:22=Hm. You have a different way of looking at battle than I've seen before.
uid01160874.msg:0079:0x00004684:01a8:23=I think you're onto something, though. Swordsmanship can be beautiful. It's not a bad idea to practice with that in mind.
uid01160874.msg:0066:0x000046FE:01b4:24=Indeed. The rigors of combat may have worn on your technique, but your fundamentals are unimpeachable.
uid01160874.msg:0058:0x00004765:01c0:25=If you continue to train here, I guarantee your swordplay will gain an impeccable grace.
uid01160874.msg:003b:0x000047BE:01cc:26=That sounds nice, but a place in a dojo doesn't come cheap.
uid01160874.msg:004d:0x000047FA:01d8:27=Consider this an exception to that rule. I ask not for coin from my students.
uid01160874.msg:0068:0x00004848:01e4:28=Rather, I've a fondness for rare swords. In lieu of payment, I would like you to bring me unique katana.
uid01160874.msg:003f:0x000048B1:01f0:29=After all, rarities are often the most beautiful of their kind!
uid01160874.msg:004e:0x000048F1:01fc:30=Finding uncommon swords for you might end up costing me more, in the long run.
uid01160874.msg:005e:0x00004940:0208:31=Haha, worry not. You may keep the blades for your own use. I merely wish to admire them, once.
uid01160874.msg:0026:0x0000499F:0214:32=Come equipped with a Fine-grade sword.
uid01160874.msg:00bd:0x000049C6:0220:33=At the Ginryu Dojo, you can learn Splendid Skills by bringing in rare swords.  These swords won't be taken away from you—simply equip a blade of the specified grade and speak to Ginryu.
uid01160874.msg:0035:0x00004A84:022c:34=All right, I'll come back when I have something rare.
uid01160874.msg:0035:0x00004ABA:0238:35=I'll be waiting with breathless anticipation for you.
uid01160874.msg:0026:0x00004AF3:0268:36=Welcome. Have you a rare sword for me?
uid01160874.msg:003d:0x00004B22:028c:37=This sword won't do... Please bring me the sword I specified.
uid01160874.msg:0026:0x00004B60:0298:38=Come equipped with a Fine-grade sword.
uid01160874.msg:0048:0x00004B88:02b0:39=Aha! A stunning piece! In the face of such beauty, I stand e'er humbled.
uid01160874.msg:006a:0x00004BD1:02bc:40=The finer a blade's adornments, the deadlier its swing, I say... Well, not literally, but it doesn't hurt.
uid01160874.msg:0021:0x00004C3C:02c8:41=So, is this worth another lesson?
uid01160874.msg:0018:0x00004C5E:02d4:42=Of course! Let us begin.
uid01160874.msg:0047:0x00004C77:02e0:43=Today, we shall focus on the pursuit of beauty during one-on-one bouts.
uid01160874.msg:0019:0x00004CBF:02ec:44=What do you have in mind?
uid01160874.msg:006f:0x00004CD9:02f8:45=First, it is crucial not to be struck by your opponent. Grace oft falters when met by bloody wound, as it were.
uid01160874.msg:007f:0x00004D49:0304:46=Of course, the practice of evasion and parrying does not give one leave to lumber about like a clod. Beauty must be maintained.
uid01160874.msg:0053:0x00004DC9:0310:47=I think I understand. It's true, your form will suffer if you take too much damage.
uid01160874.msg:0039:0x00004E1D:031c:48=Prepare to fight, and follow the instructions I give you.
uid01160874.msg:000a:0x00004E57:0328:49=All right.
uid01160874.msg:0030:0x00004E62:0334:50=You'll be facing me today! It's a pleasure, sir!
uid01160874.msg:0026:0x00004E93:0340:51=(Hmm... Which style should I go with?)
uid01160874.msg:002c:0x00004EBB:0358:52=You seem ready for another lesson. Shall we?
uid01160874.msg:0069:0x00004EE8:0364:53=Once more, we will pursue beauty in a one-on-one bout—this time while employing your other sword style.
uid01160874.msg:0063:0x00004F52:0370:54=Recall the importance of evading your opponent's blows, as well as parrying and dodging with grace.
uid01160874.msg:0032:0x00004FB6:037c:55=Now, prepare to fight, and follow my instructions!

uid01160874.msg:007a:0x0000519E:0418:63=Presently, you are prone to attacking without thought. In time, you will find your every movement considered and pristine.
uid01160874.msg:003e:0x00005219:0424:64=Hm, so putting more thought into my attacks could help? I see.

uid01160874.msg:000e:0x0000542E:0484:71=Hm. All right.
uid01160874.msg:001d:0x0000543D:0490:72=Beautiful! An inspired match!

uid01160874.msg:005d:0x00005755:0520:81=You must always take care to observe your surroundings and respond nimbly to every situation.
uid01160874.msg:0019:0x000057B3:052c:82=Hm. I think I understand.
uid01160874.msg:006d:0x000057CD:0538:83=It is now time, I believe, to put our lessons into practice. Speak to me when you are ready for another bout.
uid01160874.msg:0012:0x0000583B:0544:84=Sure, sounds good.
uid01160874.msg:0052:0x0000584E:0550:85=Well, then. What say you choose the style you wish to employ in this coming match?
uid01160874.msg:007c:0x000058A1:055c:86=I shall have you contend against one of my students, and if I find your technique to be at the level of an expert, you pass.
uid01160874.msg:00c2:0x0000591E:0568:87=For this lesson, you will only succeed if you rank as Solid at the end of your fight. You may use any abilities you've learned, but must rely solely on either the Swordsman or Wild Dancer style.
uid01160874.msg:0015:0x000059E1:0574:88=It's a pleasure, sir!
uid01160874.msg:0026:0x000059F7:0580:89=(Hmm... Which style should I go with?)
uid01160874.msg:0011:0x00005A1E:058c:90=Now, have at him!
uid01160874.msg:0011:0x00005A31:05a4:91=Now, have at him!
uid01160874.msg:0073:0x00005A46:05d4:92=I confess, I saw not the beauty from you for which I had hoped. Please, clear your mind and come back to try again.
uid01160874.msg:0049:0x00005ABB:05ec:93=Magnificent. You are a masterwork of art given life upon the battlefield.
uid01160874.msg:0025:0x00005B05:05f8:94=Yeah, I think I felt something there.
uid01160874.msg:0073:0x00005B2B:0604:95=Haha, I am overjoyed to hear it. We must continue—next time, please, bring me a truly uncommon sword, if you can.
uid01160874.msg:0026:0x00005B9F:0610:96=Come equipped with a Good-grade sword.
uid01160874.msg:0011:0x00005BC6:061c:97=Sure. I'll do it.
uid011608a5.msg:0003:0x0000190D:0044:1=Hm?
uid011608a5.msg:0026:0x00001912:005c:2=Hey, what're you doing, man!? Careful!
uid011608a5.msg:001d:0x00001939:0068:3=(What's going on over there?)
uid011608a5.msg:001d:0x00001958:0080:4=Shit! We gotta get a move on!
uid011608a5.msg:002a:0x00001976:008c:5=Hey, what do you think you're looking at!?
uid011608a5.msg:001c:0x000019A1:0098:6=Aw, damn it... We're busted.
uid011608a5.msg:0025:0x000019BF:00b0:7=(What the hell are these guys doing?)
uid011608a5.msg:004c:0x000019E5:00bc:8=Screw it! We got no choice if we've been made! This has to stay under wraps!
uid011608a5.msg:0051:0x00001A32:00c8:9=I'm not here to arrest you or anything. This isn't my concern—just let me pass.
uid011608a5.msg:0040:0x00001A84:00d4:10=Not happening, asshole! We're under strict orders from the boss!
uid011608a5.msg:002a:0x00001AC5:00e0:11=Now what in the Sam Hill is going on here?
uid011608a5.msg:0004:0x00001AF1:00f8:12=Kck!
uid011608a5.msg:004d:0x00001AF6:0104:13=B-Boss!? This guy saw the hardware, but don't worry! We're about to kill him!
uid011608a5.msg:001f:0x00001B44:0110:14=I screwed up! Forgive me, boss!
uid011608a5.msg:0068:0x00001B64:011c:15=Easy now. Everybody makes mistakes... What matters is how ya handle yourself once it happens, ya follow?
uid011608a5.msg:0077:0x00001BCD:0128:16=Now, I did say to keep this here operation on the down low. That means taking any missteps in stride... Being discreet.
uid011608a5.msg:0026:0x00001C45:0134:17=Right, yeah... Of course, boss. Sorry.
uid011608a5.msg:002f:0x00001C6C:0140:18=Hm. Reckon it ain't no difference, neither way.
uid011608a5.msg:0057:0x00001C9C:014c:19=You boys carry the goods back to the hideout. I'll have a chat with my new friend here.
uid011608a5.msg:0011:0x00001CF4:0158:20=Right away, boss.
uid011608a5.msg:0046:0x00001D0B:01a0:21='Fraid I can't have you just mosey on from this little encounter, boy.
uid011608a5.msg:0024:0x00001D52:01ac:22=So, what do you plan to do about it?
uid011608a5.msg:004f:0x00001D77:01b8:23=Haha! No need for hostilities. If I were plannin' to draw on ya, you'd know it.
uid011608a5.msg:0060:0x00001DC7:01c4:24=Truth is, I am a merchant—one who fancies himself able to fashion a fair deal for all parties.
uid011608a5.msg:0018:0x00001E28:01d0:25=You want to make a deal?
uid011608a5.msg:0069:0x00001E41:01dc:26=My crew and I got ourselves a little hole-in-the-wall 'round here. If you'd be so kind as to follow me...
uid011608a5.msg:0058:0x00001EAB:01e8:27=(Hmm... A merchant who's stockpiling that many firearms? He'd be an inconvenient enemy.)
uid011608a5.msg:0016:0x00001F04:01f4:28=All right. Let's talk.
uid011608ab.msg:0011:0x0000B519:01a4:1=What is all this?
uid011608ab.msg:0020:0x0000B52B:01b0:2=Welcome to my place of business.
uid011608ab.msg:0052:0x0000B54C:01bc:3=Allow me to introduce myself—I go by Mr. William Bradley. What shall I call you?
uid011608ab.msg:002b:0x0000B59F:01c8:4=I'm not so sure I want to give you my name.
uid011608ab.msg:002d:0x0000B5CB:01d4:5=Haha! Negotiations are built upon trust, boy!
uid011608ab.msg:0059:0x0000B600:01ec:6=Keep your lips sealed, if ya like. I assure ya, I've got ways of digging up dirty truths.
uid011608ab.msg:000d:0x0000B65A:01f8:7=Saito Hajime.
uid011608ab.msg:0036:0x0000B668:0204:8=First name Hajime? Good. Add it to the list, would ya?
uid011608ab.msg:000c:0x0000B69F:0210:9=On it, boss!
uid011608ab.msg:006f:0x0000B6AC:021c:10=Pleasure to make your acquaintance, Hajime. You know the phrase "brass tacks"? Here's where we get down to 'em.
uid011608ab.msg:0050:0x0000B71C:0228:11=What I need from you is to forget what you done saw on that street corner today.
uid011608ab.msg:0095:0x0000B76D:0234:12=Now, normally I'd estimate the price of a man's silence in terms of coin... Something tells me, though, you might find this a little more persuasive.
uid011608ab.msg:000c:0x0000B803:0240:13=What, a gun?
uid011608ab.msg:0063:0x0000B810:024c:14=Haha! A top-of-the-line piece! Nobody else is packing a heater like that in the Land of the Risin'.
uid011608ab.msg:004d:0x0000B874:0258:15=I understand. You're not trying to bribe me. You're trying to incriminate me.
uid011608ab.msg:006d:0x0000B8C2:0264:16=If you paid me, I could still turn you in. With this in my possession, though, I would have to answer for it.
uid011608ab.msg:005c:0x0000B930:0270:17=You are <i>damn</i> sharp, Hajime. If you're that quick on the uptake, this won't take long.
uid011608ab.msg:005d:0x0000B98D:027c:18=I wasn't going to tell anyone in the first place. And I don't need this, I've got my own gun.
uid011608ab.msg:005b:0x0000B9EB:0288:19=A man who's already armed and dangerous? You know, I think you and I might be fast friends!
uid011608ab.msg:005b:0x0000BA47:0294:20=I don't think we'll be friends at all. If that's everything you have to say, I'll be going.
uid011608ab.msg:001b:0x0000BAA3:02a0:21=Hm. Have it your way, then.
uid011608ab.msg:0005:0x0000BABF:02ac:22=Boss.
uid011608ab.msg:0011:0x0000BAC5:02b8:23=What have ya got?
uid011608ab.msg:0017:0x0000BAD8:02d0:24=Oh, ho—is that right?
uid011608ab.msg:000d:0x0000BAF0:02dc:25=What is this?
uid011608ab.msg:0067:0x0000BAFF:02f4:26=Begging your pardon, but it seems we might have another matter to discuss before I see you on your way.
uid011608ab.msg:0015:0x0000BB67:0300:27=What do you want now?
uid011608ab.msg:007e:0x0000BB7D:030c:28=You're Saito Hajime. A guest of Teradaya over in Fushimi. If rumor's to be believed, you're a veritable devil with that sword.
uid011608ab.msg:0061:0x0000BC03:0324:29=And to top it all off, you're with the Shinsengumi... Now, ain't that interesting as all get-out?
uid011608ab.msg:0048:0x0000BC65:0330:30=So, while you kept me busy, your men went looking for information on me?
uid011608ab.msg:0040:0x0000BCAE:033c:31=Standard procedure. I like to call it the merchant's salutation.
uid011608ab.msg:004c:0x0000BCF6:0354:32=That said, there are some things beyond even the eyes and ears of my boys...
uid011608ab.msg:0026:0x0000BD43:0360:33=You ever heard of the Urayama Company?
uid011608ab.msg:000c:0x0000BD6A:036c:34=Urayama? No.
uid011608ab.msg:006a:0x0000BD77:0378:35=I figured as much. That's the handle of the den of thieves what killed a man who was like a brother to me.
uid011608ab.msg:0073:0x0000BDE2:0384:36=There's but one reason I've planted my roots in this territory—revenge on every last one of them sons of bitches.
uid011608ab.msg:0054:0x0000BE56:0390:37=My brother was Japanese, but he never treated me like no outsider. I loved that man.
uid011608ab.msg:004b:0x0000BEAB:039c:38=And I was there the day the Company came and, in cold blood, shot him down.
uid011608ab.msg:0071:0x0000BEF7:03a8:39=Mr. Saito Hajime of the Shinsengumi, I reckon ya cross paths with them loyalist shishi on the regular, don't you?
uid011608ab.msg:0069:0x0000BF69:03b4:40=Please! If you hear even the whisper of a whisper about the Urayama Company, I need ya to bring it to me.
uid011608ab.msg:004d:0x0000BFD3:03c0:41=I ain't asking for free! I got money, weapons, anything ya want—it's yours.
uid011608ab.msg:006d:0x0000C021:03cc:42=Save it. I've also seen someone who was like family to me murdered before my eyes. I understand how you feel.
uid011608ab.msg:005d:0x0000C08F:03d8:43=But I'm not a mercenary. I don't take payment to help black market dealers avenge their dead.
uid011608ab.msg:0040:0x0000C0ED:03e4:44=Surely, there must be some way for us to come to an agreement...
uid011608ab.msg:0041:0x0000C12E:03f0:45=Please, sir! On our boss's behalf, we're begging you to help him!
uid011608ab.msg:0056:0x0000C170:03fc:46=He's a good man, really! He provides us with food and shelter, and pays us generously.
uid011608ab.msg:0018:0x0000C1C7:0408:47=Tch. Knock it off, boys.
uid011608ab.msg:0053:0x0000C1E0:0414:48=I know we've got no right to ask you, but you're the best chance he has, Saito-san!
uid011608ab.msg:002f:0x0000C234:0420:49=All we can do is beg and bow our heads! Please!
uid011608ab.msg:0017:0x0000C264:042c:50=Calm down, both of you.
uid011608ab.msg:0022:0x0000C27C:0438:51=I'll see what I can do, all right?
uid011608ab.msg:0079:0x0000C29F:0444:52=Don't expect much, I've got a lot going on and I've never heard of these guys before. If that changes, I'll let you know.
uid011608ab.msg:0009:0x0000C319:0450:53=Hajime...
uid011608ab.msg:0028:0x0000C323:045c:54=Thank you! Thank you so much, Saito-san!
uid011608ab.msg:005e:0x0000C34C:0468:55=Hey, boss, if Saito-san's getting in with us, why don't you teach him some of your techniques?
uid011608ab.msg:005e:0x0000C3AB:0474:56=Haha! Now, there's an idea! Hajime, you may carry a piece, but how well can you use the thing?
uid011608ab.msg:0036:0x0000C40A:0480:57=How well? I don't know. I mostly just point and shoot.
uid011608ab.msg:0065:0x0000C441:048c:58=No, no, no! I can't have you firing off like some hillbilly with a peashooter. Guns are works of art!
uid011608ab.msg:005b:0x0000C4A7:0498:59=I give all my boys armaments, but it's the knowhow that really lets 'em protect themselves.
uid011608ab.msg:002e:0x0000C503:04a4:60=So, what—you also give them target practice?
uid011608ab.msg:006e:0x0000C532:04b0:61=Haha, what good is knowing how to shoot a bottle or a stuffed dummy? No, I like to keep things practical here.
uid011608ab.msg:0045:0x0000C5A1:04bc:62=Hey, why don't we all welcome Saito-san to the gang by taking him on?
uid011608ab.msg:0058:0x0000C5E7:04c8:63=Not a bad idea! Load your chamber, Hajime. I'll give ya some pointers as ya take 'em on.
uid011608ab.msg:004e:0x0000C640:04d4:64=You're going to teach me better gun techniques? Fine. I'll go along with this.
uid011608ab.msg:0018:0x0000C68F:04e0:65=Okay! Y'all ready? Draw!
uid011608ab.msg:0052:0x0000C6A9:04f8:66=Great! Starting to see how there's more to a derringer than pointing and shooting?
uid011608ab.msg:0055:0x0000C6FC:0504:67=Yeah, actually. Firearms might even have as much depth to them as swordsmanship does.
uid011608ab.msg:004f:0x0000C752:0510:68=Haha! Now, that's what I like to hear, Hajime—and this is only the beginning!
uid011608ab.msg:0013:0x0000C7A2:051c:69=Mm. I'll come back.
uid011608ab.msg:0055:0x0000C7B6:0528:70=We'll help you however we can too! Please, just try to find information for the boss!
uid011608ab.msg:0037:0x0000C80C:0534:71=All right. I'll let you know if I come across anything.
uid011608ab.msg:004d:0x0000C844:0540:72=My thanks. Feel free to come and go from this place as ya please from now on.
uid011608ab.msg:0018:0x0000C892:054c:73=Oh, and one other thing.
uid011608ab.msg:0082:0x0000C8AB:0558:74=A lot of goods pass through our fingers down here. My boys are fledgling traders in their own right—might score yourself a deal.
uid011608ab.msg:0037:0x0000C92E:0564:75=Talk to 'em if you're interested in a bit of bartering.
uid011608ab.msg:0032:0x0000C966:0570:76=Or if you're just in the mood to shoot the breeze.
uid011608ab.msg:001f:0x0000C999:057c:77=Got it. I'll keep that in mind.
uid011608ab.msg:0024:0x0000C9B9:0588:78=Good. See you down the road, Hajime.
uid011608ab.msg:0016:0x0000C9DE:0594:79=Welcome back, partner.
uid011608ab.msg:006f:0x0000C9F5:05a0:80=Today, I think I'll learn ya a thing or two about special ammunition—vital for any gunslinger worth his salt.
uid011608ab.msg:0028:0x0000CA65:05ac:81=Special ammo? Yeah, I've used it before.
uid011608ab.msg:0062:0x0000CA8E:05b8:82=Mmhm, so ya said about your six-gun too. I'll see for myself if you really know what you're doing.
uid011608ab.msg:002e:0x0000CAF1:05c4:83=Take these and stand at the ready for my boys.
uid011608ab.msg:0031:0x0000CB20:05d0:84=Obtained <Color:8>Enhanced Rounds<Color:Default>.
uid011608ab.msg:002e:0x0000CB53:05e8:85=Obtained <Color:8>Flash Rounds<Color:Default>.
uid011608ab.msg:0030:0x0000CB83:0600:86=Obtained <Color:8>Thunder Rounds<Color:Default>.

uid011608ab.msg:0045:0x0000CC15:0648:89=Now that there's what we call an arsenal. Get ready to put it to use.
uid011608ab.msg:006a:0x0000CC5B:0654:90=Equip the Enhanced Rounds first. Ammunition that ain't been loaded's just some lead a corpse was carrying.
uid011608ab.msg:0024:0x0000CCC7:066c:91=Load them bullets I gave ya, Hajime.
uid011608ab.msg:002e:0x0000CCEC:0678:92=Talk to me when you're firing Enhanced Rounds.
uid011608ab.msg:005d:0x0000CD1B:0684:93=Good, that'll do. Now, make sure ya focus on the difference between these and regular rounds.
uid011608ab.msg:0012:0x0000CD79:0690:94=You all set? Draw!
uid011608ab.msg:005c:0x0000CD8D:06a8:95=Good! You're a fast learner. That kind of knowhow can make all the difference in a gunfight.
uid011608ab.msg:0086:0x0000CDEA:06b4:96=Enhanced Rounds Knowhow has been unlocked. You can learn it by inserting a Soul Orb into the corresponding slot in the Abilities menu.
uid011608ab.msg:0030:0x0000CE71:06c0:97=Hmm. Yeah, seems like there's a lot to consider.
uid011608ab.msg:0080:0x0000CEA2:06cc:98=Master that skill and you'll be able to cook up enhanced rounds at the blacksmith's. Could lead ya to further aptitudes as well.
uid011608ab.msg:0053:0x0000CF23:06d8:99=Next time I'll learn ya something real fun, Hajime. Come on back when you're ready.
uid011608ab.msg:0003:0x0000CF77:06e4:100=Mm.
uid011608ab.msg:0037:0x0000CF7B:06f0:101=Mmm. I been waiting for ya! Ready for your next lesson?
uid011608ab.msg:001c:0x0000CFB3:06fc:102=Yeah, looking forward to it.
uid011608ab.msg:004c:0x0000CFD0:0708:103=Been a rash of angry young folk toting gats of their own 'round town lately.
uid011608ab.msg:006e:0x0000D01D:0714:104=Cases such as those, the ability to dodge and return fire might just be what keeps your insides on the inside.

uid011608ab.msg:0044:0x0000D0C1:075c:109=Good! I'm sure the boys find ya one hell of a dance partner, Hajime.

uid011608ab.msg:0041:0x0000D1BE:0780:112=That's the essence of it. Now, time to really put it to the test.
uid011608ab.msg:003d:0x0000D209:07b0:113=I want to see how ya handle all of them coming at ya at once.
uid011608ab.msg:0021:0x0000D247:07bc:114=That's practically everyone here.
uid011608ab.msg:005b:0x0000D269:07c8:115=You starting to sweat? Don't worry. Each one'll leave the fight if they take a single shot.
uid011608ab.msg:0061:0x0000D2C5:07d4:116=Some of them are loaded, some aren't. Reckon ya make the ones that are packing your first target.
uid011608ab.msg:0026:0x0000D327:07e0:117=And here's the most important thing...
uid011608ab.msg:006b:0x0000D34E:07ec:118=If I see ya take too many hits yourself, I blow the whistle. I want fleet feet, Hajime, not brute strength.
uid011608ab.msg:0047:0x0000D3BA:07f8:119=Right. This is about avoiding fire and taking down enemies efficiently.
uid011608ab.msg:003b:0x0000D402:0804:120=Well said. The trial ends at thirty men down. Are ya ready?

uid011608ab.msg:0031:0x0000D7C3:0900:136=Boss! Something's going down in the alley up top!
uid011608ab.msg:0034:0x0000D7F5:090c:137=That right? Hmph, ain't none of our concern, nowise.
uid011608ab.msg:0047:0x0000D82A:0918:138=I know, but the thing is, I heard somebody mention the Urayama Company.
uid011608ab.msg:0039:0x0000D872:0924:139=Urayama? Aren't those the people you've been looking for?
uid011608ab.msg:006f:0x0000D8AC:0930:140=Shit—wasn't counting on hitting the jackpot today. It could give away the whole game if they see my face now.
uid011608ab.msg:0051:0x0000D91C:093c:141=Boss, if it's really the Urayama, I don't know if we can handle them without you.
uid011608ab.msg:0064:0x0000D96E:0948:142=You're damn right! None of y'all are to engage—not as long as that assassin of theirs is with 'em!
uid011608ab.msg:0014:0x0000D9D3:0954:143=Then, what do we do?
uid011608ab.msg:0028:0x0000D9E8:0960:144=Wait, Saito-san! Could you check it out?
uid011608ab.msg:0041:0x0000DA11:096c:145=You're a better fighter than us. You could hold your own! Please!
uid011608ab.msg:0052:0x0000DA53:0978:146=I said that I'd find information for you. Want me to see what's going on up there?
uid011608ab.msg:0018:0x0000DAA6:0984:147=I would be much obliged.
uid011608ab.msg:0017:0x0000DABF:0990:148=Fine. I'll take a look.
uid011608ab.msg:003a:0x0000DAD7:099c:149=Thank you! The boss and I will hide nearby and keep watch!

uid011608ab.msg:003c:0x0000DD38:0a8c:165=What are these guys really up to, for them to be so careful?
uid011608ab.msg:004a:0x0000DD75:0a98:166=The Company's a mercantile racket. Hell, racket's too nice a name for 'em.
uid011608ab.msg:005f:0x0000DDC0:0aa4:167=They travel around hawking foreign wares—gouging up prices on folks who don't know no better.
uid011608ab.msg:0076:0x0000DE20:0ab0:168=Obviously, they've made some enemies, so they keep assassins on the payroll to put an end to anybody who makes a fuss.
uid011608ab.msg:0038:0x0000DE97:0abc:169=They sound like the definition of disreputable salesmen.
uid011608ab.msg:0047:0x0000DED0:0ac8:170=Was one of those assassins that did my best friend and brother, Saemon.
uid011608ab.msg:002d:0x0000DF18:0ad4:171=You said he was killed right in front of you?
uid011608ab.msg:0060:0x0000DF46:0ae0:172=Back then, I wasn't in the arms business. I was just selling food and other goods from overseas.
uid011608ab.msg:0079:0x0000DFA7:0aec:173=Saemon was a magistrate in Nagasaki. Never treated me like some American hayseed—he helped me out. He became my friend.
uid011608ab.msg:007a:0x0000E021:0af8:174=I like to think he knew I came over here with the best intentions. I wanted to help Japan see what the world had to offer.
uid011608ab.msg:0083:0x0000E09C:0b04:175=It's starting to make sense. You ran an honest business, so Saemon treated you favorably—which probably got in the Urayama's way.
uid011608ab.msg:005a:0x0000E120:0b10:176=Exactly. See, Saemon had no toleration for anybody who came looking to exploit his people.
uid011608ab.msg:0072:0x0000E17B:0b1c:177=Meaning that getting rid of him and me at the same time would be two birds with one stone for the Urayama Company.
uid011608ab.msg:0042:0x0000E1EE:0b28:178=But Saemon died and you're still alive. Do they know you survived?
uid011608ab.msg:003d:0x0000E231:0b34:179=If they did, I expect they'd have come finish the job by now.
uid011608ab.msg:0051:0x0000E26F:0b40:180=Right. But what about now? Those men we just fought might tell them they saw you.
uid011608ab.msg:0069:0x0000E2C1:0b4c:181=Haha. This day was always fixing to arrive, sooner or later. Time to start making our final preparations.
uid011608ab.msg:0063:0x0000E32B:0b58:182=Thank you for your help, Hajime. Come back again soon and we'll see what else we do for each other.
uid011608ab.msg:0010:0x0000E38F:0b64:183=Yeah. All right.
uid011608ab.msg:003c:0x0000E3A0:0b70:184=Ah, welcome back! How about we learn ya something new today?
uid011608ab.msg:0011:0x0000E3DD:0b7c:185=That sounds good.
uid011608ab.msg:0033:0x0000E3EF:0b88:186=Yessir! I've got two techniques for ya this time...

uid011608ab.msg:000a:0x0000E5A9:0be8:193=All right.
uid011608ab.msg:0074:0x0000E5B4:0bf4:194=I want ya to shoot down every man I throw your way in the time limit. Ya gotta be swift and ya gotta shoot straight.

uid011608ab.msg:003a:0x0000E92E:0c90:204=Got it. So, any new developments with the Urayama Company?
uid011608ab.msg:007d:0x0000E969:0c9c:205=Some of the boys are looking into that now. We have to proceed with caution, here—got to assume they've found out about us.
uid011608ab.msg:005a:0x0000E9E7:0ca8:206=Hajime, when we're ready to smoke them sons of bitches out, can I count on you to join us?
uid011608ab.msg:0019:0x0000EA42:0cb4:207=Why do you want me there?
uid011608ab.msg:0082:0x0000EA5C:0cc0:208=I've seen ya fight. You're not only strong, but ya keep a cool head. My boys have trained, but they ain't never faced real combat.
uid011608ab.msg:006b:0x0000EADF:0ccc:209=And to let ya in on the god's honest truth of it all... the Company near-killed me once before. I'm scared.
uid011608ab.msg:0080:0x0000EB4B:0cd8:210=Hm. If this were just some personal vendetta, I probably wouldn't get involved. But from what I've seen, it's not just a grudge.
uid011608ab.msg:0070:0x0000EBCC:0ce4:211=I'm sure you want revenge for Saemon, but I get the feeling you also want to stop them from hurting anyone else.
uid011608ab.msg:0042:0x0000EC3D:0cf0:212=Might be so... It's been an awful long time since my brother died.
uid011608ab.msg:004b:0x0000EC80:0cfc:213=And the Urayama Company has kept right on extorting and killing ever since.
uid011608ab.msg:006c:0x0000ECCC:0d08:214=All things considered, you might be the only person who can stop them. I understand why you'd be scared now.
uid011608ab.msg:0022:0x0000ED39:0d14:215=All right. I'll be there with you.
uid011608ab.msg:0008:0x0000ED5C:0d20:216=Ya will?
uid011608ab.msg:0042:0x0000ED65:0d2c:217=When the time comes, let me know. We'll see this through together.
uid011608ab.msg:005c:0x0000EDA8:0d38:218=Much obliged, Hajime. For a man with the devil's own eyes, you've got a good soul inside ya.
uid011608ab.msg:0022:0x0000EE05:0d44:219=Is that your way of saying thanks?
uid011608ab.msg:004c:0x0000EE28:0d50:220=Haha! All right, then. One of the boys will contact ya when it's going down.
uid011608ab.msg:0007:0x0000EE75:0d5c:221=Got it.

uid011608ab.msg:007b:0x0000F8B2:0ff0:270=Yeah—got it in my mind that I'd like to have a duel with you. Reckon it could do both of us good to face someone skilled.

uid011608e0.msg:0011:0x0000DDD3:01f4:8=What should I do?
uid011608e0.msg:007a:0x0000DDE5:0200:9=Keep up the attack. The more time your adversaries spend on their back feet, the fewer chances they'll have to strike you.
uid011608e0.msg:0039:0x0000DE60:020c:10=A nigh-ceaseless assault can be a thing of beauty indeed.
uid011608e0.msg:002e:0x0000DE9A:0218:11=So like they say, offense is the best defense?
uid011608e0.msg:004e:0x0000DEC9:0224:12=Most surely. And I will teach you a technique to properly manifest this creed.

uid011608e0.msg:0064:0x0000E058:0284:19=Recall the importance of keeping up your attack, and denying your opponents opportunities to strike.

uid011608e0.msg:007d:0x0000E66C:0434:46=I shall have you contend against five of my students, and if I find your technique to be at the level of an expert, you pass.
uid011608e0.msg:00c2:0x0000E6EA:0440:47=For this lesson, you will only succeed if you rank as Sharp at the end of your fight. You may use any abilities you've learned, but must rely solely on either the Swordsman or Wild Dancer style.

uid011608e0.msg:001d:0x0000EB86:0590:66=Most certainly. Let us begin.
uid011608e0.msg:0055:0x0000EBA4:059c:67=This time, let us reflect on maintaining composure in the face of a deadly adversary.
uid011608e0.msg:0075:0x0000EBFA:05a8:68=Much of what we've learned thus far will bear relevance here. Avoid your opponent's blows and maintain the offensive.
uid011608e0.msg:005b:0x0000EC70:05b4:69=However, the stronger your opponent, the more difficult it can be to maintain one's beauty.
uid011608e0.msg:0063:0x0000ECCC:05c0:70=One method to claim the advantage is to capitalize on any opening with something bold and decisive.

uid011608e0.msg:007b:0x0000ED64:05d8:72=Of course, this mustn't come at the expense of your fundamentals. Abandoning them in pursuit of flash will be your undoing.

uid011608e0.msg:0025:0x0000F745:080c:111=My apologies for this whole incident.
uid011608e0.msg:0057:0x0000F76C:0824:112=You return. As I said, there is no need for you to bring me another treasure. Shall we?
uid011608e0.msg:0015:0x0000F7C4:0830:113=(Hm, should I train?)
uid011608e0.msg:0043:0x0000F7DA:083c:114=Welcome back. I apologize once again for what transpired last time.
uid011608e0.msg:0019:0x0000F81E:0848:115=With Heinosuke, you mean?
uid011608e0.msg:004c:0x0000F838:0854:116=From what I've been hearing, you're right that he has a lot to grapple with.
uid011608e0.msg:006e:0x0000F885:0860:117=He was one of our dojo's first pupils, you know. I couldn't have hoped for one with more talent or dedication.
uid011608e0.msg:0070:0x0000F8F4:086c:118=After battling him, you must have seen for yourself—he just needs help eradicating the doubt that plagues him.
uid011608e0.msg:006f:0x0000F965:0878:119=That may be true, but it seems like it's more than just his doubt. This whole place feels nervous and insecure.
uid011608e0.msg:0058:0x0000F9D5:0884:120=Maybe Heinosuke can't take those last steps he needs to because of the environment here.
uid011608e0.msg:0073:0x0000FA2E:0890:121=I... am at a loss for words. You shame me, though I cannot claim you're wrong. These are my apprentices, after all.
uid011608e0.msg:002c:0x0000FAA2:089c:122=The onus is on me to lead them. I shall try.
uid011608e0.msg:003b:0x0000FACF:08a8:123=All right. So, what kind of sword should I bring here next?
uid011608e0.msg:001d:0x0000FB0B:08b4:124=Ah, I've failed to mention...
uid011608e0.msg:0075:0x0000FB29:08c0:125=To apologize for what transpired in our last session, I would offer the next lesson freely. We may begin at any time.
uid011608e0.msg:0015:0x0000FB9F:08cc:126=(Hm, should I train?)
uid011608e0.msg:0033:0x0000FBB5:08d8:127=Maybe later. I've got things to take care of first.
uid011608e0.msg:0027:0x0000FBE9:08e4:128=Of course. Return whenever you're able.
uid011608e0.msg:0014:0x0000FC11:08f0:129=All right, let's go.
uid011608e0.msg:0018:0x0000FC26:08fc:130=Excellent. Let us begin.
uid011608e0.msg:0055:0x0000FC3F:0908:131=Today, we shall practice a technique designed to elegantly deflect an enemy's weapon.
uid011608e0.msg:0007:0x0000FC95:0914:132=Got it.
uid011608e0.msg:001c:0x0000FC9D:0920:133=Please, use only your sword.
uid011608e0.msg:0072:0x0000FCBA:092c:134=Now, you'll be facing my students... Hm. Their disposition seems somewhat different today. What could be going on?
uid011608e0.msg:0009:0x0000FD2D:0938:135=I wonder.
uid011608e0.msg:0013:0x0000FD37:0944:136=Well, regardless...
uid011608e0.msg:0016:0x0000FD4B:0950:137=We'll show <i>you</i>.
uid011608e0.msg:0015:0x0000FD62:095c:138=No losing, this time.
uid011608e0.msg:0013:0x0000FD78:0968:139=Well, have at them!
uid011608e0.msg:003f:0x0000FD8D:0980:140=Fabulous! I swear, your form becomes more beautiful every time!
uid011608e0.msg:008e:0x0000FDCD:098c:141=Splendid Skill: Rustling Leaves has been unlocked. You can learn it by inserting a Soul Orb into the corresponding slot in the Abilities menu.
uid011608e0.msg:0007:0x0000FE5C:0998:142=Grrr...
uid011608e0.msg:003d:0x0000FE64:09a4:143=I can't believe the four of us at our best couldn't beat him.
uid011608e0.msg:003a:0x0000FEA2:09b0:144=Hm. Like I said, none of your students have what it takes.
uid011608e0.msg:007f:0x0000FEDD:09bc:145=Saito-kun? What's gotten into you? You may be strong, but I'll not have you speak this way of men who've trained so tirelessly.
uid011608e0.msg:0024:0x0000FF5D:09c8:146=Right. And it's on you to lead them.
uid011608e0.msg:001c:0x0000FF82:09d4:147=Yes. We have discussed this.
uid011608e0.msg:0036:0x0000FF9F:09e0:148=Nevertheless, when you are willing, we shall continue.
uid011608e0.msg:000a:0x0000FFD6:09ec:149=All right.
uid011608e0.msg:002c:0x0000FFE2:0a04:150=You seem ready for another lesson. Shall we?
uid011608e0.msg:0046:0x0001000F:0a10:151=This lesson concerns maintaining one's grace while surrounded by foes.
uid011608e0.msg:0020:0x00010056:0a1c:152=I'll be taking on a group again?
uid011608e0.msg:0045:0x00010077:0a28:153=No matter how great the enemy's number, your movement mustn't falter.
uid011608e0.msg:0071:0x000100BD:0a34:154=Create distance when necessary, and always consider where the most advantageous location on the battlefield lies.
uid011608e0.msg:007f:0x0001012F:0a40:155=Irrespective of the forces before you, fighting with beauty will naturally leave your opponents with fewer openings to exploit.
uid011608e0.msg:0031:0x000101AF:0a4c:156=I expect to see you perform at a masterful level.
uid011608e0.msg:00c2:0x000101E1:0a58:157=For this lesson, you will only succeed if you rank as Sharp at the end of your fight. You may use any abilities you've learned, but must rely solely on either the Swordsman or Wild Dancer style.
uid011608e0.msg:000b:0x000102A4:0a64:158=Understood.
uid011608e0.msg:0009:0x000102B0:0a70:159=No mercy.
uid011608e0.msg:0014:0x000102BA:0a7c:160=We'll win this time.
uid011608e0.msg:0026:0x000102CF:0a88:161=(Hmm... Which style should I go with?)
uid011608e0.msg:0012:0x000102F6:0a94:162=Now, have at them!
uid011608e0.msg:0012:0x0001030A:0aac:163=Now, have at them!
uid011608e0.msg:0026:0x0001031E:0ac4:164=Welcome back. I knew you would return.
uid011608e0.msg:0053:0x00010345:0ad0:165=Once more, we shall have you face a group of adversaries. Remember, beauty matters.
uid011608e0.msg:0032:0x00010399:0adc:166=It is my wish to see a masterful display from you.
uid011608e0.msg:000e:0x000103CC:0ae8:167=We won't lose!
uid011608e0.msg:0012:0x000103DB:0af4:168=You're going down!
uid011608e0.msg:0026:0x000103EE:0b00:169=(Hmm... Which style should I go with?)
uid011608e0.msg:0073:0x00010417:0b24:170=I confess, I saw not the beauty from you for which I had hoped. Please, clear your mind and come back to try again.
uid011608e0.msg:003f:0x0001048B:0b30:171=Fabulous! I swear, your form becomes more beautiful every time!
uid011608e0.msg:0088:0x000104CB:0b3c:172=Mirage of Shimmering Heat has been unlocked. You can learn it by inserting a Soul Orb into the corresponding slot in the Abilities menu.
uid011608e0.msg:0005:0x00010554:0b48:173=Grgh!
uid011608e0.msg:001f:0x0001055A:0b54:174=There's no winning against him!
uid011608e0.msg:002c:0x0001057A:0b60:175=Why is it that I always win against you all?
uid011608e0.msg:0043:0x000105A7:0b6c:176=You're just gloating now! Do you want us to admit that we're weak!?
uid011608e0.msg:003b:0x000105EB:0b78:177=You're misunderstanding me. None of you lack swordsmanship.
uid011608e0.msg:0076:0x00010627:0b84:178=You've trained hard and developed great technique. I'm asking—why am I still able to beat you, in spite of all that?
uid011608e0.msg:0072:0x000106A5:0b9c:179=That is enough! Saito-kun, I am the master of this school. The blame for their loss falls upon no one else but me.
uid011608e0.msg:0060:0x00010718:0ba8:180=You and your students are desperate. The dojo hasn't got much time left before you leave, right?
uid011608e0.msg:0047:0x00010779:0bb4:181=I see. So, you've spoken to my students... Yes, you've the right of it.
uid011608e0.msg:004f:0x000107C1:0bc0:182=They didn't just tell me the situation, they asked me to take it over from you.
uid011608e0.msg:0056:0x00010811:0bcc:183=How does it make you feel, for your own apprentices to ask an outsider to succeed you?
uid011608e0.msg:0022:0x00010868:0bd8:184=Well... perhaps they have a point.
uid011608e0.msg:0064:0x0001088B:0be4:185=Of course, it would be my preference to leave the dojo in the hands of one of my apprentices, but...
uid011608e0.msg:0072:0x000108F0:0bf0:186=My most promising student, Heinosuke, is not even here. I've not seen him in days, and the others are losing hope.
uid011608e0.msg:0058:0x00010963:0bfc:187=Considering all that, perhaps it is in our best interests to bequeath our school to you.
uid011608e0.msg:0038:0x000109BC:0c08:188=So, once you've finished teaching me, the place is mine?
uid011608e0.msg:0018:0x000109F5:0c14:189=That is... satisfactory.
uid011608e0.msg:002d:0x00010A0E:0c20:190=All right. Then I've got nothing else to say.
uid011608e0.msg:0048:0x00010A3C:0c2c:191=I'll take the dojo, and I'll decide what to do with it when you're gone.
uid011608e0.msg:0008:0x00010A85:0c38:192=Damn it!
uid011608e0.msg:0003:0x00010A8F:0c50:193=No!
uid011608e0.msg:000a:0x00010A94:0c68:194=Very well.
uid011608e0.msg:0080:0x00010A9F:0c74:195=In that case, I would ask you to bring me a sword of truly timeless craftsmanship. It will stand as proof of your determination.
uid011608e0.msg:0026:0x00010B20:0c80:196=Come equipped with a Best-grade sword.
uid011608e0.msg:003d:0x00010B47:0c8c:197=The next lesson will be our last. I'll be waiting, Saito-kun.
uid011608e0.msg:0026:0x00010B86:0ca4:198=Welcome. Have you a rare sword for me?
uid011608e0.msg:003d:0x00010BB5:0cc8:199=This sword won't do... Please bring me the sword I specified.
uid011608e0.msg:0026:0x00010BF3:0cd4:200=Come equipped with a Best-grade sword.
uid011608e0.msg:007f:0x00010C21:0cec:201=It's... astonishing. Most would go their whole lifetime without ever glimpsing such a blade. To think, you would bring me this.
uid011608e0.msg:0023:0x00010CA1:0cf8:202=So, is it time for the last lesson?
uid011608e0.msg:0015:0x00010CC5:0d04:203=Tis so. Let us begin.
uid011608e0.msg:0074:0x00010CDB:0d10:204=I've no more techniques to bestow upon you. All that remains is for you to show me what you've learned... in combat.
uid011608e0.msg:0047:0x00010D50:0d1c:205=And if I beat you, you'll recognize me as the successor to your school?
uid011608e0.msg:0004:0x00010D98:0d28:206=Yes.
uid011608e0.msg:0039:0x00010D9D:0d34:207=I must admit, I've some misgivings about this, Saito-kun.
uid011608e0.msg:005a:0x00010DD7:0d40:208=The will of my pupils, the legacy of my school of thought, the nature of your character...
uid011608e0.msg:0036:0x00010E32:0d4c:209=There is much I must discern for myself in this fight.
uid011608e0.msg:005c:0x00010E69:0d58:210=I am certain the answers lie in battle with you. When you are ready, please draw your blade.
uid011608e0.msg:0067:0x00010EC6:0d64:211=If you defeat me, and perform at the level of a true master, then I will name you the head of our dojo.
uid011608e0.msg:00c2:0x00010F2E:0d70:212=For this lesson, you will only succeed if you rank as Sharp at the end of your fight. You may use any abilities you've learned, but must rely solely on either the Swordsman or Wild Dancer style.
uid011608e0.msg:0026:0x00010FF1:0d7c:213=(Hmm... Which style should I go with?)
uid011608e0.msg:000c:0x00011018:0d88:214=Have at you!
uid011608e0.msg:000c:0x00011026:0da0:215=Have at you!
uid011608e0.msg:000e:0x00011034:0db8:216=There you are.
uid011608e0.msg:0037:0x00011043:0dc4:217=If you wish, we may attempt the final lesson once more.
uid011608e0.msg:0021:0x0001107B:0dd0:218=Defeat me, with a master's grace.
uid011608e0.msg:0026:0x0001109D:0ddc:219=(Hmm... Which style should I go with?)
uid011608e0.msg:006c:0x000110C6:0e00:220=It appears even you are ill-suited to succeed me. A shame. If you like, we may try again when you are ready.
uid011608e0.msg:003c:0x00011133:0e0c:221=Impressive... Your strength and beauty defy my expectations.
uid011608e0.msg:0089:0x00011174:0e48:222=Ash from Withered Branches has been unlocked. You can learn it by inserting a Soul Orb into the corresponding slot in the Abilities menu.
uid011608e0.msg:0087:0x000111FE:0e54:223=Essence of Winged Flight has been unlocked. You can learn it by inserting a Soul Orb into the corresponding slot in the Abilities menu.
uid011608e0.msg:0037:0x00011286:0e60:224=I suppose, with you as my successor, I can rest easy...
uid011608e0.msg:0005:0x000112BE:0e6c:225=Wait!
uid011608e0.msg:000b:0x000112C5:0e84:226=Heinosuke!?
uid011608e0.msg:002e:0x000112D1:0e90:227=Ginryu-sensei! Please, give me another chance!
uid011608e0.msg:0052:0x00011300:0e9c:228=I've heard what's been going on—you're going to hand over the dojo to Saito-san!
uid011608e0.msg:003e:0x00011353:0ea8:229=But he has no intentions of passing on your technique, sensei!
uid011608e0.msg:0018:0x00011392:0eb4:230=Is this true, Saito-kun?
uid011608e0.msg:005e:0x000113AB:0ec0:231=Like I tried to tell your students, that's the risk you take leaving the place to an outsider.
uid011608e0.msg:005f:0x0001140A:0ecc:232=Are you really going to entrust your legacy to someone just because they're a strong swordsman?
uid011608e0.msg:0007:0x0001146A:0ed8:233=Well...
uid011608e0.msg:0053:0x00011472:0ee4:234=When I heard that was what the other apprentices wanted, I couldn't bear the shame.
uid011608e0.msg:002f:0x000114C6:0ef0:235=So, I went to the mountains to recenter myself.
uid011608e0.msg:005d:0x000114F6:0efc:236=Reflecting on sensei's teachings, I swung my blade—over and over again. Then, I realized...
uid011608e0.msg:0059:0x00011554:0f08:237=I lacked determination! I lacked the courage to cast everything else aside for this dojo!
uid011608e0.msg:0031:0x000115B5:0f20:238=Ginryu-sensei, may I please have one more chance?
uid011608e0.msg:000c:0x000115E7:0f2c:239=Heinosuke...
uid011608e0.msg:0032:0x000115F4:0f38:240=The look in your eyes has changed since last time.
uid011608e0.msg:0063:0x00011627:0f44:241=This place was comfortable for you, with your sensei and fellow students. You had no enemy to fear.
uid011608e0.msg:0044:0x0001168B:0f50:242=More than that... this dojo reminds me of a school with no teachers.
uid011608e0.msg:0034:0x000116D0:0f5c:243=You all have skill, but none of you have aspiration.
uid011608e0.msg:000c:0x00011705:0f68:244=Saito-kun...
uid011608e0.msg:005d:0x00011712:0f74:245=Ginryu, you clearly care deeply for your students, and I won't deny you've been good to them.
uid011608e0.msg:0074:0x00011770:0f80:246=But a nobleman can't teach hunger. You're a great swordsman, but your students needed someone to drive them further.
uid011608e0.msg:0026:0x000117E5:0f8c:247=Saito-san! That's really how you feel?
uid011608e0.msg:006c:0x0001180C:0f98:248=I admire the way you all want to protect your dojo and your technique, but the world isn't so accommodating.
uid011608e0.msg:007b:0x00011879:0fa4:249=Heinosuke, if you want to inherit this place, you'll need more than a swordsman's ability—you'll need a swordsman's will.
uid011608e0.msg:004b:0x000118F5:0fb0:250=I... Thank you, Saito-san! Please, forgive me for the things I said to you.
uid011608e0.msg:004f:0x00011941:0fbc:251=I owe you an apology as well—both of you. I am humbled, and I am truly sorry.
uid011608e0.msg:0077:0x00011991:0fc8:252=Perhaps I grew impatient, knowing sand was slipping from the hourglass. I was blind to what my apprentices needed most.
uid011608e0.msg:0077:0x00011A09:0fd4:253=I believe in the beauty of swordsmanship, yet that beauty cannot merely be judged by sight. It dwells within the heart.
uid011608e0.msg:0032:0x00011A81:0fe0:254=In my own school, I am the most ignorant man here.
uid011608e0.msg:0009:0x00011AB4:0fec:255=Sensei...
uid011608e0.msg:002d:0x00011ABE:0ff8:256=Heinosuke, I am so grateful to see you again.
uid011608e0.msg:0081:0x00011AEC:1004:257=With the resolve you've shown in returning, I'd have every confidence leaving our school in your care. Would you still accept it?
uid011608e0.msg:0012:0x00011B6E:1010:258=Of course, sensei!
uid011608e0.msg:003b:0x00011B81:101c:259=Saito-kun, I believe I owe you more than words can express.

uid011608e0.msg:005a:0x00011E7C:10dc:271=I sense power laying dormant within you, actually—I could attempt to unleash that power.
uid011608e0.msg:001f:0x00011ED7:10e8:272=Sounds like it could be useful.
uid011608e0.msg:0065:0x00011EF7:10f4:273=If you're prepared, we could start immediately. This will be a one-on-one battle, between you and me.

uid011608e0.msg:006d:0x000128CA:1340:307=I shall leave the dojo in the care of Heinosuke now. We must needs confer, with what time I've yet remaining.

uid01160b7a.msg:003a:0x00003A97:01c4:30=The Urayama Company hired you as an assassin, didn't they?
uid01160b7a.msg:004c:0x00003AD2:01d0:31=Is this why you trained as a gunman? To take money from people like Amagiya?

uid01160b7a.msg:0079:0x00003BAD:0200:35=He's been deeply indebted to me for years, you see. All his firearms training has been for my sake. Isn't that so, Zenji?

uid01160b7a.msg:0072:0x00003C31:0218:37=I mislike people who make faulty assumptions about others. Oh well, I'll graciously consider them your last words.

uid01160b7a.msg:0025:0x00003E67:02b4:47=Eh? I mean... Y-You didn't hear that!
uid01160b7a.msg:0060:0x00003E8D:02c0:48=You said he was indebted to you. What you really meant is that you have his sister held hostage!
uid01160b7a.msg:0066:0x00003EEE:02cc:49=So that's why Zenji didn't kill William back then—he could never obey your orders with a full heart!
uid01160b7a.msg:0053:0x00003F55:02d8:50=That kind of doubt would get in the way of anyone's ability to finish off a target.

uid01160b7a.msg:0057:0x00003FD2:02fc:53=So, the man I took for an assassin all this time was just another of Amagiya's victims.

uid01160b7a.msg:007e:0x000044DA:03e0:71=And I'm fixing to deliver all my paperwork to a magistrate, right along with your sorry hide. That'll bring your company down.

uid01160b7a.msg:0072:0x0000457A:0410:73=Zenji, right? My condolences, but I can't let ya walk away from this. Truth is, part of me still can't forgive ya.
uid01160b7a.msg:000d:0x000045ED:041c:74=I understand.
uid01160b7a.msg:0080:0x000045FB:0428:75=Shooting you won't do nobody any good, however. It'll just leave some girl out there mourning a dead brother, same as I've done.
uid01160b7a.msg:0078:0x0000467C:0434:76=I'm through with playing a part in this whole circle of vengeance. So, I need ya to turn yourself in, 'longside Amagiya.

uid01160bb8.msg:0060:0x00000C4D:0074:6=Well, he said he's game whenever you are, Saito-san. Just let me know, and I'll take you myself.
uid01160bb8.msg:0085:0x00000CAE:0080:7=He needs advance notice, or else he won't be prepared for the fight. So I'll let him know we're coming whenever you say you're ready.

uid01160bb8.msg:005b:0x00000E40:00bc:12=Wasn't he the assassin who took out the great Sodachi? Should I call up the Third Division?
uid01160bb8.msg:0020:0x00000E9C:00c8:13=No... I'll go to the duel alone.
uid01160bb8.msg:0066:0x00000EBD:00d4:14=What!? Uh, I don't mean to doubt your skills Saito-san, but it doesn't seem smart to go by yourself...
uid01160bb8.msg:004a:0x00000F24:00e0:15=I know the risks. But I have to settle things with him myself. One on one.
uid01160bb8.msg:006d:0x00000F6F:00ec:16=It's more than just avenging Sodachi. I feel like my fate is intertwined with that of Amon's. It's strange...
uid01160bb8.msg:0047:0x00000FDD:00f8:17=But nevertheless, I will cross swords with him, and I will do it alone.
uid01160bb8.msg:0054:0x00001025:0104:18=...That's some strong convictions you got. I'm not gonna stop you after that speech.
uid01160bb8.msg:004b:0x0000107A:0110:19=Anyhow, Amon said he'd wait at the stage in Kiyomizu Temple, late at night.
uid01160bb8.msg:0026:0x000010C6:011c:20=Kiyomizu Temple, late evening. Got it.
uid01160bb9.msg:0033:0x00000BAA:0080:1=Gah! It can't be... It's impossible for me to lose!
uid01160bb9.msg:0048:0x00000BDE:008c:2=Seems like you should've enjoyed <i>your</i> confidence while you could.
uid01160bb9.msg:0042:0x00000C27:0098:3=I won't accept this! I won't! Saito Hajime, you will pay for this!
uid01160bb9.msg:000c:0x00000C6D:00c8:4=Argh... Ugh.
uid01160bb9.msg:001b:0x00000C7A:00d4:5=Sodachi! Are you all right?
uid01160bb9.msg:007e:0x00000C96:00e0:6=The wound itself isn't serious... But it still feels as though all my strength and knowledge of so many years is leaving me...
uid01160bb9.msg:0031:0x00000D15:00ec:7=Whatever dark magic that sword possesses is real.
uid01160bb9.msg:0051:0x00000D47:00f8:8=Look at the state of me, after challenging you to a duel. I'm sorry I did that...
uid01160bb9.msg:0020:0x00000D99:0104:9=No, you don't have to apologize.
uid01160bb9.msg:0089:0x00000DBA:0110:10=I'll do my best to regain what I've lost, but... I can feel that this mysterious force will never let it happen. What is to become of me?
uid01160bb9.msg:0047:0x00000E44:011c:11=Amon said the curse will pass on to your descendants. If that's true...
uid01160bb9.msg:0054:0x00000E8C:0128:12=Don't say it, Saito. I may have lost my power, but I haven't lost my warrior spirit.
uid01160bb9.msg:0085:0x00000EE1:0134:13=After all, I reached the point when I was able to cross swords with you. So whatever tomorrow brings, I know I can finish my journey.
uid01160bb9.msg:0048:0x00000F67:0140:14=...I respect that. And when Amon challenges me again, I will avenge you.
uid01160bb9.msg:0024:0x00000FB0:014c:15=That is good to hear. I am thankful.
uid01160bc1.msg:0030:0x000010AD:0044:1=So... the great Saito Hajime actually showed up.
uid01160bc1.msg:002a:0x000010DE:0050:2=Or should I say, Sakamoto Ryoma showed up.
uid01160bc1.msg:001a:0x00001109:005c:3=How do you know that name?
uid01160bc1.msg:0080:0x00001124:0068:4=Oh, I took a pretty close look at your life. I know where you trained, where you lay your head at night, who your friends are...
uid01160bc1.msg:007e:0x000011A5:0074:5=Honestly it would've been easy to just kill you in your sleep or take your friends hostage. Only my sense of honor stopped me.
uid01160bc1.msg:0075:0x00001224:0080:6=It'll be best to just settle things with you right here. <i>That</i> will show everyone the true strength of my clan.
uid01160bc1.msg:0056:0x0000129A:008c:7=Enough speechmaking. We both have things we fight for, and we both know what they are.
uid01160bc1.msg:006a:0x000012F1:0098:8=Heh. You're an interesting man, Sakamoto Ryoma. It's actually a shame to kill you at this point in time...
uid01160bc1.msg:006b:0x0000135C:00a4:9=But unfortunately, this is our final farewell. I hereby challenge you once again, for the pride of my clan.
uid01160bc1.msg:003e:0x000013C8:00b0:10=It's curtains for you here at Kiyomizu Temple, Sakamoto Ryoma!
uid01160bc1.msg:002c:0x00001409:00d4:11=How is it possible...? Why can't I beat you?
uid01160bc1.msg:008d:0x00001436:00e0:12=Because while you are strong, stronger than anyone I've ever fought, and I can tell how much blood and sweat you've put into your training...
uid01160bc1.msg:0058:0x000014C4:00ec:13=Ultimately, that only gets you so far. It only helps you strike your enemy consistently.
uid01160bc1.msg:005a:0x0000151D:00f8:14=You'll never achieve your highest potential if you only train to become physically strong.
uid01160bc1.msg:007b:0x00001578:0104:15=Because when you meet someone of equal strength, the man who swings with his heart as well as his blade will be the victor.
uid01160bc1.msg:0026:0x000015F4:0110:16=You dare say I don't fight with heart?
uid01160bc1.msg:0069:0x0000161B:011c:17=I'm sure you believe that you do. And of course I can't say for certain what lives in another man's soul.
uid01160bc1.msg:0058:0x00001685:0128:18=But... you did just lose a battle which depended more on heart than mind. That's a fact.
uid01160bc1.msg:0018:0x000016DE:0134:19=Ryoma? Go fuck yourself.
uid01160bc1.msg:0083:0x000016F7:0140:20=I think you'd give Sodachi's power back to him if I forced you, but I'm not sure <i>he</i> would want that. He's on a new path now.
uid01160bc1.msg:005c:0x0000177B:014c:21=As for you, Amon, I know you're an assassin, but perhaps you should reflect on how you live.
uid01160bc1.msg:0086:0x000017D8:0158:22=And afterwards, if you find you still need to cut me down, then come challenge me again. I'll always fight you with everything I have.
uid01160bc1.msg:000d:0x0000185F:0164:23=See you then.

uid01160dca.msg:0013:0x00000744:004c:4=Is something wrong?
uid01160dca.msg:0078:0x00000759:0064:5=Oh. I come 'ere every day to draw water from this well. Today, though, I found this of all things. Wonder if it fell in.

uid012616b5.msg:003b:0x000020B7:01c4:22=We're all ready to help you keep the peace in Kyo, Captain!
uid012616b5.msg:0064:0x000020F3:01d0:23=All six of them, that is. Narita himself constitutes 17% of the Third Division, in fact. Rounded up.

uid012616b5.msg:002b:0x00002315:0230:29=Every trooper has separate Corporal Traits.
uid012616b5.msg:0056:0x00002342:0248:30=Those skills are always in effect, which can render them vital to a mission's success!

uid012616b5.msg:0061:0x0000253C:02d8:38=However, stronger foes are hiding deeper in those caves, so make sure not to let your guard down.

uid012616b5.msg:005d:0x00002672:0314:42=However, that cave only held small-timers. There are much fiercer outlaws waiting further in.
uid012616b5.msg:008a:0x000026D0:0320:43=It might be necessary to increase our numbers. If you happen to defeat someone and they show an interest, I encourage you to recruit them.

uid01330c9e.msg:002c:0x0000B6E1:09c4:124=Okay! What time do you think you'll be back?
uid01330c9e.msg:0024:0x0000B70E:09d0:125=I'm not really sure today, actually.
uid01330c9e.msg:0073:0x0000B733:09dc:126=Well, be careful, Uncle Hajime. People always come up to you out of nowhere and pull you into the strangest things!
uid01330c9e.msg:0046:0x0000B7A7:09e8:127=Don't worry, I'm sure that won't happen again. I'll be fine. Probably.
uid01330c9e.msg:004a:0x0000B7EE:09f4:128=Haha, if you say so! Be sure to take care of yourself, okay? See you soon.
uid01330c9e.msg:0011:0x0000B839:0a00:129=See you soon too.
uid01330c9e.msg:002a:0x0000B84B:0a0c:130=Should I draw a bath, before you get home?
uid01330c9e.msg:001f:0x0000B876:0a18:131=It'll be late tonight, I think.
uid01330c9e.msg:003b:0x0000B896:0a24:132=Then I bet you'll appreciate a warm bath when you get home!
uid01330c9e.msg:001b:0x0000B8D2:0a30:133=Hm. Yeah, that sounds nice.
uid01330c9e.msg:0073:0x0000B8EE:0a3c:134=Well, be careful, Uncle Hajime. People always come up to you out of nowhere and pull you into the strangest things!

uid01330c9e.msg:0023:0x0000BA06:0a6c:138=I shouldn't be long, I don't think.
uid01330c9e.msg:0032:0x0000BA2A:0a78:139=Oh, really? Will you want a bath when you're home?
uid01330c9e.msg:0015:0x0000BA5D:0a84:140=Mm, that sounds nice.
uid01330c9e.msg:001f:0x0000BA73:0a90:141=Okay! It'll be waiting for you.
uid01330c9e.msg:0007:0x0000BA93:0a9c:142=Thanks.
uid01330c9e.msg:0019:0x0000BA9B:0aa8:143=No, don't worry about it.
uid01330c9e.msg:006a:0x0000BAB5:0ab4:144=You're sure? You always seem so worn out when you come back... I think I'll draw one anyway, just in case.
uid01330c9e.msg:000f:0x0000BB20:0ac0:145=Heh. All right.
uid01330c9e.msg:0022:0x0000BB30:0acc:146=Oh, Uncle Hajime, take this too...
uid01330c9e.msg:0032:0x0000BB54:0ae4:147=Obtained <Color:8>Haruka's Omusubi<Color:Default>.
uid01330c9e.msg:0054:0x0000BB88:0afc:148=I'm sorry that it isn't much... If you don't want it, it's okay if you throw it out.
uid01330c9e.msg:001d:0x0000BBDD:0b08:149=No, it looks good. Thank you.
uid01330c9e.msg:000d:0x0000BBFB:0b14:150=Eh... Haha...
uid01330c9e.msg:001c:0x0000BC09:0b20:151=All right, then. Time to go.
uid01330c9e.msg:0022:0x0000BC26:0b2c:152=Mm! Have a good day, Uncle Hajime!
uid01330c9e.msg:001b:0x0000BC53:0bb0:153=(Right. Time to get going.)
uid01330c9e.msg:001c:0x0000BC71:0bd4:154=Ah, Haruka, I'm leaving now.
uid01330c9e.msg:002d:0x0000BC8E:0be0:155=Oh. Okay, sir. I hope you... have a good day.
uid01330c9e.msg:0016:0x0000BCBC:0bec:156=Hmm... That's no good.
uid01330c9e.msg:0016:0x0000BCD3:0bf8:157=Um, wh-what's no good?
uid01330c9e.msg:006e:0x0000BCEA:0c04:158=Haruka, we're sharing a roof together. You don't have to be so formal. How about... treating me like a friend?
uid01330c9e.msg:0029:0x0000BD59:0c10:159=Oh. Of course... I'll do that, Saito-san.
uid01330c9e.msg:0049:0x0000BD83:0c1c:160=Hmm... That too. Calling me Saito-san like I'm your boss isn't necessary.
uid01330c9e.msg:0036:0x0000BDCD:0c28:161=Eh? O-Of course. So then, what should I call you, sir?
uid01330c9e.msg:000c:0x0000BE04:0c34:162=Let's see...
uid01330c9e.msg:0019:0x0000BE11:0c40:163=Sa-chan. Like we're pals.
uid01330c9e.msg:0050:0x0000BE2B:0c4c:164=Sa—Sa-chan? Um... Don't take this the wrong way, but... it's awfully friendly.
uid01330c9e.msg:0054:0x0000BE7C:0c58:165=You're right. It sounded off as soon as I said it. Forget that one, let's go with...
uid01330c9e.msg:001d:0x0000BED1:0c64:166=Hajime-chan. That seems nice.
uid01330c9e.msg:0058:0x0000BEEF:0c70:167=Ha—Hajime-chan? I don't know, if I'm being honest. You'd sound like my little brother.
uid01330c9e.msg:002c:0x0000BF48:0c7c:168=Oh. Well, that's awkward. What's that leave?
uid01330c9e.msg:0062:0x0000BF75:0c88:169=I guess it's presumptuous to come up with a nickname on the spot. For now, just... call me Hajime.
uid01330c9e.msg:0045:0x0000BFD8:0c94:170=Hajime? Almost... How about one step further, though... Uncle Hajime?
uid01330c9e.msg:006e:0x0000C01E:0ca0:171=*sigh* Have it your way. I do have an uncle's face. Just hoped I'd be... a little older before people said so.
uid01330c9e.msg:0023:0x0000C08D:0cac:172=Oh, I'm sorry. That was rude of me.
uid01330c9e.msg:0053:0x0000C0B1:0cb8:173=No, I got us into this—not you. I'm happy with Uncle Hajime. So then, we're good?
uid01330c9e.msg:001e:0x0000C105:0cc4:174=Yes! I like the sound of that.
uid01330c9e.msg:0046:0x0000C124:0cd0:175=That's what matters. I'll be on my way for now, then. So... take care.
uid01330c9e.msg:000a:0x0000C16B:0cdc:176=Okay, sir!
uid01330c9e.msg:0020:0x0000C176:0ce8:177=Not "okay, sir"... "Okay." Okay?
uid01330c9e.msg:0024:0x0000C197:0cf4:178=Okay! Have a good day, Uncle Hajime!

uid01330d90.msg:0067:0x0000086B:0090:3=Yes. My parents were deeply religious. They said this shrine had gods living in it, just like a temple.
uid01330d90.msg:0050:0x000008D3:009c:4=Shrines function just like temples, and you can use them to channel your Virtue.

uid01520002.msg:0063:0x00000A54:010c:4=In Pineapple Hold'em, however, you begin with three cards in your hand instead of the standard two.
uid01520002.msg:0059:0x00000AB8:0118:5=You will then discard one of the three cards in your hand to arrive at the requisite two.

uid01520002.msg:0057:0x00000BFF:0148:9=One of your cards has the same value as a community card. Therefore, you have one pair.

uid01520002.msg:00b6:0x00000CF0:0160:11=Depending on how confident you feel about your own hand, you can raise (increase the bet), call (match the bet), or fold (quit). However, best not fold now, for the sake of practice.

uid016c007e.msg:000f:0x00003D10:0138:14=Hm. Impressive.
uid016c007e.msg:006a:0x00003D20:0144:15=They're notorious for destroying small companies like mine so that they can have a monopoly over the city.
uid016c007e.msg:0014:0x00003D8B:0150:16=How do they do that?
uid016c007e.msg:0057:0x00003DA0:015c:17=By making a show of outrunning the competition in public to drive down our reputations.
uid016c007e.msg:0080:0x00003DF8:0168:18=Couriers live and die by the public's trust in their deliveries. Beating us in front of customers is as good as killing us dead.
uid016c007e.msg:0033:0x00003E79:0174:19=That's how they've buried almost every other group.
uid016c007e.msg:0034:0x00003EAD:0180:20=Is what he's saying true? Why would you all do that?
uid016c007e.msg:0068:0x00003EE2:018c:21=What a stupid question. The goal of any business is to crush the competition! Surely you know that much.
uid016c007e.msg:0070:0x00003F4B:0198:22=Besides, customers have a right to the fastest deliveries! If your feet are too weak and slow, to hell with you!
uid016c007e.msg:0074:0x00003FBC:01a4:23=For too long, the couriers of this city have taken it easy. We've simply shown what's possible with powerful hooves!
uid016c007e.msg:0074:0x00004031:01b0:24=And all the other outfits can do is cry about fair enterprise and claim to do business with "heart" and "integrity."
uid016c007e.msg:0067:0x000040A6:01bc:25=Meaningless concepts, spoken by losers! The Black Panther Couriers will drive them all into the ground!
uid016c007e.msg:0017:0x0000410E:01c8:26=Kyo is <i>our</i> city.
uid016c007e.msg:000e:0x00004126:01d4:27=You guys suck!
uid016c007e.msg:0047:0x0000413C:01ec:28=My name is Inamoto. I'm known as the Black Panther Couriers' playmaker.
uid016c007e.msg:0030:0x00004184:01f8:29=Makino. The Black Panther Couriers' leading man.
uid016c007e.msg:0050:0x000041B5:0204:30=Takeda's the name. The girls all call me the Black Panther Couriers' ladykiller.
uid016c007e.msg:0039:0x00004206:0210:31=And I am the Black Panther Couriers' raid captain, Hoshi.
uid016c007e.msg:0045:0x00004240:021c:32=So, what are you all doing here? There a reason you stopped Kiyokawa?
uid016c007e.msg:0030:0x00004286:0228:33=We're not here for him. Our quarrel is with you.
uid016c007e.msg:000d:0x000042B7:0234:34=What quarrel?
uid016c007e.msg:0030:0x000042C5:0240:35=The other day, you picked up this loser's slack.
uid016c007e.msg:0057:0x000042F6:024c:36=We had our eyes on you. Have to say, a nice performance. You have the feet of a winner.
uid016c007e.msg:003e:0x0000434E:0258:37=And it was Kiyokawa's company who got to claim all the credit.
uid016c007e.msg:0057:0x0000438D:0264:38=No good, friend. We were so close to shutting them down until you gave them a reprieve.
uid016c007e.msg:0019:0x000043E5:0270:39=Eh!? Shut your face down!
uid016c007e.msg:005c:0x000043FF:027c:40=Now suddenly people are talking about this new fastest courier in Kyo, and he's not with us.
uid016c007e.msg:0062:0x0000445C:0288:41=We don't take kindly to embarrassment like that. You went and inserted yourself into our business.
uid016c007e.msg:003e:0x000044BF:0294:42=Damn right. No amateur letter-runner messes with the Panthers.
uid016c007e.msg:0033:0x000044FE:02a0:43=So, how about we settle this right here, right now?
uid016c007e.msg:0019:0x00004532:02ac:44=What do you have in mind?
uid016c007e.msg:001f:0x0000454C:02b8:45=Healthy competition, of course.
uid016c007e.msg:0003:0x0000456C:02c4:46=Eh?
uid016c007e.msg:0066:0x00004570:02d0:47=We deliver letters, head-to-head. That way, we can prove the Black Panther Couriers are still fastest.
uid016c007e.msg:000d:0x000045D7:02dc:48=How about it?
uid016c007e.msg:000f:0x000045E5:02e8:49=Not interested.
uid016c007e.msg:0062:0x000045F5:02f4:50=If you don't, we'll put every resource we have toward grinding Kiyokawa and his company into dust.
uid016c007e.msg:0005:0x00004658:0300:51=Okay.
uid016c007e.msg:0028:0x0000465E:030c:52=Hey! That is <i>not</i> okay! Saito-san!
uid016c007e.msg:002c:0x00004687:0318:53=Heh. Don't you couriers know what jokes are?
uid016c007e.msg:0051:0x000046B4:0324:54=To be honest, after that whole speech, I'm happy to take these guys down a notch.
uid016c007e.msg:001c:0x00004706:0330:55=Now we're talking. Who's up?
uid016c007e.msg:003a:0x00004723:033c:56=Right here. My calf muscles are twitching with excitement.
uid016c007e.msg:0040:0x0000475E:0348:57=The raid captain, Hoshi! I've heard he's their fastest sprinter!
uid016c007e.msg:0025:0x0000479F:0354:58=Saito-san, this is going to be tough.
uid016c007e.msg:0040:0x000047CC:036c:59=The rules are simple. First to deliver ten letters wins. Got it?
uid016c007e.msg:0005:0x0000480D:0378:60=Fine.
uid016c007e.msg:0066:0x00004813:0384:61=How about I make this a fair contest and walk on my hands? I certainly don't need my legs to beat you.
uid016c007e.msg:0028:0x0000487A:0390:62=Sounds like you need your mouth, though.
uid016c007e.msg:0021:0x000048A3:039c:63=Tch! All right, then. Let's race!
uid016c007e.msg:0014:0x000048C8:03cc:64=*pant* *pant* I win.
uid016c007e.msg:000e:0x000048DD:03d8:65=How the hell!?
uid016c007e.msg:0039:0x000048EC:03e4:66=I don't believe it, Saito-san! You beat the raid captain!
uid016c007e.msg:0047:0x00004926:03f0:67=Hmph. So, he's better than we assumed. You went too easy on him, Hoshi.
uid016c007e.msg:000a:0x0000496E:03fc:68=S-Sorry...
uid016c007e.msg:0053:0x00004979:0408:69=We'll let you go for now, but this isn't over. Next time, we'll destroy you, Saito!
uid016c007e.msg:004e:0x000049CE:0420:70=(That Hoshi really was a good sprinter. Taking on more of them won't be easy.)
uid016c007e.msg:000d:0x00004A23:0474:71=*pant* *pant*
uid016c007e.msg:0012:0x00004A31:0480:72=Heheheh. No sweat.
uid016c007e.msg:0054:0x00004A44:048c:73=But... I don't understand, you were faster the other day. Are you sick or something?
uid016c007e.msg:0063:0x00004A99:0498:74=Beating you at this level won't clear our name. We need to show people we're better than your best.
uid016c007e.msg:0058:0x00004AFD:04a4:75=Let's go again! As soon as you're a hundred percent! You'd better give it your all then.
uid016c0089.msg:0024:0x00002288:0048:1=Stop fooling around! Where is Saito?
uid016c0089.msg:0040:0x000022AD:0054:2=How should I know!? You all are the ones crushing on him so bad!
uid016c0089.msg:0038:0x000022EE:0060:3=I don't buy it! I've seen how friendly you are with him.
uid016c0089.msg:0049:0x00002327:006c:4=I'm a friendly guy! People always tell me I have excellent social skills.
uid016c0089.msg:0015:0x00002372:0084:5=What's going on here?
uid016c0089.msg:0029:0x00002388:0090:6=Ah! Saito-san! Boy, am I glad to see you!
uid016c0089.msg:0020:0x000023B2:009c:7=He finally makes his appearance.
uid016c0089.msg:0030:0x000023D3:00a8:8=You're one of the Black Panther Couriers, right?
uid016c0089.msg:0072:0x00002404:00b4:9="One of"? Hardly. I'm the Black Panther Couriers' leading man, Makino! And I'll be the one that defeats you today.
uid016c0089.msg:0084:0x00002477:00c0:10=You do realize I wouldn't even deliver any more letters if you didn't keep forcing me to race? You <i>could</i> just leave me alone.
uid016c0089.msg:0075:0x000024FC:00cc:11=That's not happening. Not after you beat Hoshi, sloppy as it was. A win's a win and we can't let a win go unanswered.
uid016c0089.msg:0013:0x00002572:00d8:12=This is ridiculous.
uid016c0089.msg:006d:0x00002586:00e4:13=Makino, the leading man. He's famous for his panache, like when he dances after making a successful delivery.
uid016c0089.msg:0069:0x000025F4:00f0:14=But he's got skills to back it up. His endurance allows him to deliver and deliver without ever stopping.
uid016c0089.msg:002a:0x0000265E:00fc:15=Heheheh. This one's got an eye for talent.
uid016c0089.msg:0003:0x00002689:0108:16=Hm.
uid016c0089.msg:0044:0x0000268D:0114:17=Let's keep it nice and simple. First to deliver twelve letters wins?
uid016c0089.msg:000b:0x000026D2:0120:18=Fine by me.
uid016c0089.msg:001f:0x000026DE:012c:19=Then let's go, courier-samurai!
uid016c0089.msg:0014:0x00002701:015c:20=*pant* *pant* I win.
uid016c0089.msg:003c:0x00002716:0168:21=I don't believe my eyes! Two in a row against the Panthers!?
uid016c0089.msg:004c:0x00002753:0174:22=Damn it all! I made one wrong turn, that's it! If not for that I'd... I'd...
uid016c0089.msg:0022:0x000027A0:0180:23=Race me again! Just one more time!
uid016c0089.msg:0025:0x000027C4:0198:24=You're embarrassing yourself, Makino.
uid016c0089.msg:007d:0x000027EA:01a4:25=Recovering from wrong turns is as important a skill as any. If you can't do that, you sully the Black Panther Couriers' name.
uid016c0089.msg:000c:0x00002868:01b0:26=D-Damn it...
uid016c0089.msg:000b:0x00002875:01bc:27=Saito, yes?
uid016c0089.msg:0005:0x00002881:01c8:28=Yeah.
uid016c0089.msg:006c:0x00002887:01d4:29=It looks like I'll have to face you myself. You were lucky to defeat Makino, but that's as far as you'll go.
uid016c0089.msg:0079:0x000028F4:01e0:30=I'm the Black Panther Couriers' playmaker because no one can overcome my strategic ability. My deliveries know no errors.
uid016c0089.msg:0020:0x0000296E:01ec:31=Your luck's run out, I'm afraid.
uid016c0089.msg:0074:0x00002996:0204:32=It wouldn't be sporting to compete with you now after you just raced. Rest well, your days of victory are at an end.
uid016c0089.msg:0018:0x00002A0B:0210:33=See you soon. Heh heh...
uid016c0089.msg:004f:0x00002A25:0228:34=(Inamoto will be next, huh? Judging by his confidence, this might not be easy.)
uid016c0089.msg:0010:0x00002A75:0234:35=Um... Saito-san.
uid016c0089.msg:0013:0x00002A86:0240:36=Hm? Yeah, Kiyokawa?
uid016c0089.msg:0038:0x00002A9A:024c:37=I've just been, um, wondering... about our relationship.
uid016c0089.msg:006f:0x00002AD3:0258:38=We <i>are</i> friends, right? I mean, it's hard to tell with you and... I don't want to assume anything, but...
uid016c0089.msg:000d:0x00002B51:02c4:39=*pant* *pant*
uid016c0089.msg:0024:0x00002B5F:02d0:40=What the hell? Is that all you got!?
uid016c0089.msg:004a:0x00002B84:02dc:41=I thought you'd offer me a challenge! Ha! I'm disappointed, Saito, really.
uid016c0089.msg:0047:0x00002BCF:02e8:42=And I'm deeply unsatisfied. Come back once you're ready to get serious!
uid016c008c.msg:0017:0x0000624E:0110:1=Looks like you had fun.
uid016c008c.msg:0019:0x00006280:0254:2=That'll be 1 ryo, please.
uid016c008c.msg:002b:0x0000629A:0260:3=Thank you very much. Hope to see you again.
uid016c008c.msg:0031:0x000062CA:029c:4=Thank you for today. I hope I see you again soon.
uid016c008c.msg:00e5:0x000062FC:02a8:5=You have formed a bond with Anna. You can deepen your bond by continuing to interact with her and filling the bond gauge. You can also check the status of your gauge in Diligence Records in the Pause Menu. Try to visit her often.
uid016c008c.msg:005b:0x000063E2:02b4:6=Promise me you'll be back... You wouldn't leave poor little Anna all by herself, would you?
uid016c008c.msg:001a:0x00006453:03bc:7=Were you not feeling well?
uid016c008c.msg:0032:0x0000646E:03c8:8=That was... wonderful. Oh, you're the <i>best</i>.
uid016c008c.msg:003e:0x000064A8:0428:9=Damn... That's a spirit breaker. Guess I should call it a day.
uid016c008c.msg:003f:0x000064EA:0458:10=Damn, think I'm starting to see double... I better head home...
uid016c008c.msg:003e:0x0000652D:0488:11=Phew... Looks like I win. You okay? You didn't drink too much?
uid016c008c.msg:0028:0x0000656C:0494:12=Nope. I'm drunk and feeling juuust fine.
uid016c008c.msg:0025:0x00006595:04a0:13=H-Hey now. You sure you're all right?

uid016c008c.msg:002b:0x00006620:04c4:16=Hehehe! I hope you're ready to bare it all!

uid016c008c.msg:001b:0x0000671D:050c:21=Heh... All right, I'm game.
uid016c008c.msg:002b:0x00006739:0518:22=Hehehe! I hope you're ready to bare it all!
uid016c008c.msg:0022:0x00006768:0548:23=Pleased to make your acquaintance.
uid016c008c.msg:0014:0x0000678B:0554:24=Pleasure's all mine.
uid016c008c.msg:001d:0x000067A0:0560:25=Do you have any good stories?
uid016c008c.msg:004e:0x000067BE:056c:26=Heh. Way to put me on the spot. I'm not too good at this sort of thing, but...
uid016c008c.msg:0021:0x00006811:05a8:27=What do you think? Terrible, huh?
uid016c008c.msg:0017:0x00006833:05b4:28=Hehehehe. You're funny.
uid016c008c.msg:000d:0x0000684B:05c0:29=You think so?
uid016c008c.msg:0005:0x00006859:05cc:30=I do.
uid016c008c.msg:001a:0x0000685F:05d8:31=How are you feeling today?

uid016c008c.msg:0016:0x000068AE:05fc:34=I'm doing pretty good.
uid016c008c.msg:003a:0x000068C5:0608:35=Glad to hear it. That means we can have lots of fun today.
uid016c008c.msg:0016:0x00006900:0614:36=Yeah, I think so, too.
uid016c008c.msg:0009:0x00006917:0620:37=I'm okay.
uid016c008c.msg:004c:0x00006921:062c:38=Well, please don't push yourself. Your health and life are what's important.
uid016c008c.msg:000d:0x0000696E:0638:39=Yeah, I know.
uid016c008c.msg:0023:0x0000697C:0644:40=I'm a little tired, to be honest...
uid016c008c.msg:0030:0x000069A0:0650:41=Really? Then, here, let me make you feel better!
uid016c008c.msg:0014:0x000069D1:065c:42=Hehe. I'd like that.
uid016c008c.msg:001d:0x000069E6:0668:43=I know! Let's have some sake.
uid016c008c.msg:001e:0x00006A04:0674:44=How much do you want to drink?
uid016c008c.msg:001d:0x00006A23:0680:45=I'm planning to go big today.
uid016c008c.msg:0039:0x00006A41:068c:46=I'll be responsible today. A regular serving's just fine.
uid016c008c.msg:001b:0x00006A7B:0698:47=I'll keep it light for now.
uid016c008c.msg:001e:0x00006A97:06a4:48=Of course. I'll be right back.
uid016c008c.msg:0021:0x00006ABA:06e0:49=Mm... Good stuff. Keep it coming.
uid016c008c.msg:001d:0x00006ADC:06ec:50=How about a drinking contest?

uid016c008c.msg:0021:0x00006B42:0704:52=I wouldn't have it any other way.
uid016c008c.msg:0023:0x00006B65:071c:53=How about another drinking contest?
uid016c008c.msg:0040:0x00006B89:0728:54=You really like contests, huh? I won't go easy on you, you know.
uid016c008c.msg:0021:0x00006BCA:0734:55=I wouldn't have it any other way.
uid016c008c.msg:002b:0x00006BEE:0758:56=Well... I suppose we all have our off days.
uid016c008c.msg:0035:0x00006C1C:077c:57=Oh my... You're amazing. Thank you for a lovely time.
uid016c008c.msg:002b:0x00006C54:07a0:58=I'm bowing out... Oh, I'm so embarrassed...
uid016c008c.msg:0039:0x00006C80:07ac:59=Heh, that was a good time. Anyhow, take care of yourself.
uid016c008c.msg:0014:0x00006CBA:07b8:60=What? You're going!?
uid016c008c.msg:0032:0x00006CCF:07c4:61=Yeah. I just wanted to play Rock, Paper, Scissors.
uid016c008c.msg:000b:0x00006D02:07d0:62=Oh, okay...
uid016c008c.msg:003e:0x00006D11:0800:63=Damn... That's a spirit breaker. Guess I should call it a day.
uid016c008c.msg:003f:0x00006D53:0830:64=Damn, think I'm starting to see double... I better head home...
uid016c008c.msg:002a:0x00006D95:0854:65=I lose. You can really hold your own, huh?
uid016c008c.msg:0023:0x00006DC0:0860:66=Phew... You're not so bad yourself.
uid016c008c.msg:0012:0x00006DE8:089c:67=Welcome. I'm Anna.

uid016c00b1.msg:0043:0x0000B4D7:006c:1=I'm really sorry. I don't think that was what you were looking for.
uid016c00b1.msg:0025:0x0000B51B:0078:2=No, it's not your fault. It's mine...
uid016c00b1.msg:0084:0x0000B541:0084:3=Like the children said, I should never have pretended to know things just to save face. That's not what any good academic should do.
uid016c00b1.msg:0059:0x0000B5CD:009c:4=In fact, such antics are shameful no matter who you are. At my age, I should know better.
uid016c00b1.msg:003b:0x0000B627:00a8:5=Well, look at it this way. Academia's all about learning...
uid016c00b1.msg:0067:0x0000B663:00b4:6=And that includes your own shortcomings, right? My pops used to say even teachers have plenty to learn.

uid016c00b1.msg:0082:0x0000B7F5:00fc:12=Yes... Yes, I'm going to do it! I will rid myself of hubris, I will study every day, I will prioritize truth in this age of chaos!
uid016c00b1.msg:0079:0x0000B878:0108:13=You and the children have inspired me in my very core. Thank you, Saito-san... Please take this, it's the least I can do.

uid016c00b1.msg:0026:0x0000B9AE:0144:16=You got that right. Good luck, Sensei.
uid016c00b1.msg:007f:0x0000B9DE:01bc:17=Good for you, Sensei. I could tell how much the kids loved you, and that's an achievement which takes more than just knowledge.
uid016c00b1.msg:0085:0x0000BA5E:01c8:18=I've never been more ashamed. Now, it's imperative that I redeem myself. It's clear I have much to learn, even after all these years.
uid016c00b1.msg:0049:0x0000BAE4:01d4:19=I shall be a student, just like the children, here in this humble school.
uid016c00b1.msg:003d:0x0000BB2E:01e0:20=Heh. But you'll still get the promised donation money, right?
uid016c00b1.msg:0050:0x0000BB6C:01ec:21=Ahhh, so you remembered. I was almost wondering if you'd let me keep your share.
uid016c00b1.msg:004c:0x0000BBBD:01f8:22=Yeah, right. You're not the kind of person who'd do that. You're too honest!
uid016c00b1.msg:0071:0x0000BC0A:0204:23=Hahaha. You give me too much credit, you know. But anyway, before I forget, here's your reward. Hope you like it.

uid016c00b1.msg:0071:0x0000BCB0:0234:25=Saito-sensei, thank you so much. I'll remember you for the rest of my time on Earth, however limited that may be!
uid016c00b1.msg:0024:0x0000BD22:0240:26=That means a lot. Good luck, Sensei.
uid016c00b1.msg:0074:0x0000BD4E:02a0:27=Today, children, we'll be learning all about geography. With this globe here that your parents gifted to the school!
uid016c00b1.msg:003c:0x0000BDC3:02ac:28=Wait a second, Sensei. I was just wondering, who's that guy?
uid016c00b1.msg:0064:0x0000BE00:02b8:29=Yes, of course, let me introduce him. I asked him to help out with the class today as my apprentice.
uid016c00b1.msg:000e:0x0000BE65:02c4:30=Apprentice...?
uid016c00b1.msg:002c:0x0000BE74:02d0:31=Um, yes! If that's okay with you, of course?
uid016c00b1.msg:0029:0x0000BEA1:02dc:32=(Fine. I'll play along with the old man.)
uid016c00b1.msg:0043:0x0000BECB:02e8:33=Hello. I'm Saito Hajime, Sensei's apprentice. Nice to meet you all.
uid016c00b1.msg:004d:0x0000BF0F:02f4:34=So does that mean Saito-sensei is gonna tell us about globes and stuff today?
uid016c00b1.msg:000d:0x0000BF5D:0300:35=That's right.
uid016c00b1.msg:004c:0x0000BF6B:030c:36=Okay! Thanks for answering the question. I'm excited to see what you can do.
uid016c00b1.msg:0055:0x0000BFB8:0318:37=Did you just say "to see what you can do"? Come now, don't be rude to your superiors.
uid016c00b1.msg:0079:0x0000C00E:0324:38=Sorry, Sensei... It's just you never had an apprentice before. I didn't know what they can do! That's all it was, honest!
uid016c00b1.msg:0049:0x0000C088:0330:39=Well, I just never had the opportunity before. So think before you speak.
uid016c00b1.msg:005c:0x0000C0D2:033c:40=(That kid's the type to question everything... I won't be able to fake my way through this.)
uid016c00b1.msg:002a:0x0000C12F:0348:41=Come on, Sensei. Teach us about the globe.
uid016c00b1.msg:0042:0x0000C15A:0354:42=Yes, please. Also, are we allowed to ask any questions we want to?
uid016c00b1.msg:003e:0x0000C19D:0360:43=Of course. We'll answer any question we can. Right, Saito-kun?
uid016c00b1.msg:0037:0x0000C1DC:036c:44=Sure, sounds fine. It may be a challenge, but I accept.
uid016c00b1.msg:0038:0x0000C214:0378:45=Hehe. Well, I hope it's not <i>too</i> much a challenge!
uid016c00b1.msg:001c:0x0000C24D:0384:46=Okay, Sensei. Where is this?
uid016c00b1.msg:005c:0x0000C26A:0390:47=(Aha. I think I can answer this type of question, at least. These are just kids, after all.)
uid016c00b1.msg:0023:0x0000C2C7:039c:48=Sensei, what's this country called?
uid016c00b1.msg:0033:0x0000C2EC:03b4:49=Well, I'll tell you. This small island nation is...
uid016c00b1.msg:006f:0x0000C322:03d8:50=Japan. Yup, pretty small when you look at it on the globe, isn't it? All of us Japanese people live right here.
uid016c00b1.msg:003b:0x0000C392:03e4:51=Wh-What...! That tiny island is our great nation of Japan!?
uid016c00b1.msg:0023:0x0000C3CE:03f0:52=What, you didn't know that, Sensei?
uid016c00b1.msg:0069:0x0000C3F2:03fc:53=Oh, uh, no, I knew. I-I'm just showing you students how to look surprised. It's important for politeness.
uid016c00b1.msg:002d:0x0000C45C:0408:54=Hm. Okay, sure... I guess that could be true.
uid016c00b1.msg:0072:0x0000C48A:0414:55=You, Saito-sensei, I'm impressed with you. It seems you've seen a globe before at least, hehe! Teach us some more.
uid016c00b1.msg:0054:0x0000C4FD:0420:56=Yes, very impressive, Saito-kun. You're good at remembering the things I taught you.
uid016c00b1.msg:002b:0x0000C552:042c:57=Uh, of course. I have you to thank, Sensei.
uid016c00b1.msg:0055:0x0000C57E:0438:58=But you know! That question was too easy! So let me tell you something my dad said...
uid016c00b1.msg:0091:0x0000C5D4:0444:59=He promised to make a really big donation to this school, but <i>only</i> if I tell him that you're giving us what he calls "a proper education."
uid016c00b1.msg:000b:0x0000C666:0450:60=Really...!?
uid016c00b1.msg:008e:0x0000C672:045c:61=Yes, but if you're giving us a bad education, then I'm gonna have this place shut down. So you better not be telling us any wrong information!
uid016c00b1.msg:0063:0x0000C708:0474:62=I just don't like our time being wasted, that's all. So, ready for the next question, Saito-sensei?
uid016c00b1.msg:0078:0x0000C76C:0480:63=Uh... Yes, that's fine. I'll have you know this school has only ever taught the most up-to-date and correct information.
uid016c00b1.msg:0062:0x0000C7E5:048c:64=To refrain from accepting a donation for this very normal thing would be absurd. Right, Saito-kun?
uid016c00b1.msg:0008:0x0000C848:0498:65=...Sure.
uid016c00b1.msg:006f:0x0000C851:04a4:66=Of course it would be. And just think how it would benefit <i>you</i> as well as me. So please... do your best.
uid016c00b1.msg:001f:0x0000C8C1:04b0:67=Heh. All right. Let's continue.
uid016c00b1.msg:002c:0x0000C8E1:04bc:68=Hehehe. Okay, great! Let's keep going, then!
uid016c00b1.msg:006e:0x0000C90F:04d4:69=That would be Britain. It's a small country which is currently trying to take over the world, including Japan.
uid016c00b1.msg:003b:0x0000C97E:04e0:70=Ah, so that's this "Great Britain" I've been hearing about!
uid016c00b1.msg:0049:0x0000C9BA:04ec:71=Saito-sensei, you must be joking. Right? Surely you were just testing us?
uid016c00b1.msg:0005:0x0000CA04:04f8:72=What?
uid016c00b1.msg:004b:0x0000CA0A:0504:73=I don't mean to be rude, but that's Japan. I know 'cause my father told me.
uid016c00b1.msg:007c:0x0000CA5D:051c:74=I assume you were joking when you said it was Britain, Sensei. Maybe you thought I like jokes because I'm a child. I do not.
uid016c00b1.msg:0050:0x0000CADA:0528:75=Y-Yes, do lay off the humor, Saito-kun. He doesn't seem to possess that faculty.
uid016c00b1.msg:004b:0x0000CB2B:0534:76=I hate being taught things that turn out to be wrong. So here's the deal...
uid016c00b1.msg:0088:0x0000CB77:0540:77=If you share any wrong information, I'm gonna have this school shut down <i>today</i>. Sorry, but it's true. I won't waste my time here.
uid016c00b1.msg:006e:0x0000CC00:054c:78=But on the other hand... If you tell us some proper facts, then my dad will make a big donation to the school.
uid016c00b1.msg:000f:0x0000CC6F:0558:79=Wait, he will!?
uid016c00b1.msg:0060:0x0000CC7F:0564:80=So I guess you can say the stakes of the game are high. Ready to answer questions, Saito-sensei?
uid016c00b1.msg:007a:0x0000CCE0:0570:81=It's fine, this is all fine. We have no problem with the stakes being high because we only ever teach correct information!
uid016c00b1.msg:0080:0x0000CD5B:057c:82=So, of course we are happy to engage with this proposal. Ha...ha... I mean why would we turn down an opportunity for a donation?
uid016c00b1.msg:000c:0x0000CDDC:0588:83=Why, indeed.
uid016c00b1.msg:0077:0x0000CDE9:0594:84=We wouldn't! You and me, we're going to do our very best to answer questions so that we can get that donation... Right?
uid016c00b1.msg:002c:0x0000CE61:05a0:85=Right. Don't worry, I'm done playing around.
uid016c00b1.msg:002d:0x0000CE8E:05ac:86=Hehe. Oh, you are? Then should we keep going?
uid016c00b1.msg:002a:0x0000CEBC:05b8:87=Saito-sensei, can I ask the next question?
uid016c00b1.msg:002e:0x0000CEE7:05c4:88=Ah, Omitsu. Of course, ask Saito-kun anything.
uid016c00b1.msg:004c:0x0000CF16:05d0:89=Um... Okay, how about this big country by Japan? What's this country called?
uid016c00b1.msg:0051:0x0000CF63:05dc:90=(Heh. Oh, the very famous country with 4,000 years of history? That's so easy...)
uid016c00b1.msg:0022:0x0000CFB5:05e8:91=Come on, Sensei. What's it called?
uid016c00b1.msg:002e:0x0000CFD9:0600:92=Don't worry, I'll tell you. That country is...
uid016c00b1.msg:000e:0x0000D00A:0624:93=Great Britain.
uid016c00b1.msg:006b:0x0000D019:0630:94=Stop kidding around, Saito-san. Are you really saying that Britain is located right across the sea from us?
uid016c00b1.msg:0063:0x0000D085:063c:95=W-Well, Saito-kun? Is what you said correct? Is the country Omitsu asked about truly Great Britain?
uid016c00b1.msg:0024:0x0000D0E9:0648:96=No, wait. On second thought, it's...
uid016c00b1.msg:0052:0x0000D112:0684:97=It's the United States of America, the country that sent the Black Ships to Japan.
uid016c00b1.msg:0029:0x0000D165:0690:98=Wow. I didn't know it was so close to us.
uid016c00b1.msg:0061:0x0000D18F:069c:99=Uh, you have to be joking, Saito-san. Are you really trying to convince us that's the U.S. of A.?
uid016c00b1.msg:006b:0x0000D1F1:06a8:100=I-Is what you said wrong, Saito-kun? Is the country Omitsu asked about really the United States of America?
uid016c00b1.msg:0034:0x0000D25D:06b4:101=Hold on. Now that I think about it, it's actually...
uid016c00b1.msg:007d:0x0000D296:06f0:102=It's the Great Qing empire. Actually, the Qing Dynasty began its reign over that land around the same time as the Edo Bakufu.
uid016c00b1.msg:0049:0x0000D314:06fc:103=Oh, so that's where the Great Qing is... Wow, it's way bigger than Japan.
uid016c00b1.msg:004c:0x0000D35E:0708:104=Heh. Pretty good answer, Saito-sensei. That is indeed the Great Qing empire.
uid016c00b1.msg:0083:0x0000D3AB:0714:105=And I know more, too! Its nickname is the Sleeping Lion, even though it got invaded by Britain recently. They might attack us next!
uid016c00b1.msg:0087:0x0000D42F:0720:106=That's right—the Western powers are trying to colonize Japan! And the Edo Bakufu is so weak, they're letting it happen. Unacceptable!
uid016c00b1.msg:0088:0x0000D4B7:072c:107=That's why the loyalist shishi are risking their lives to defeat the Bakufu. It could be the only way to save Japan from foreign powers!
uid016c00b1.msg:005a:0x0000D540:0738:108=Sounds like something that should be its own lesson, Sensei. Can we get back to the globe?
uid016c00b1.msg:0032:0x0000D59B:0744:109=Good idea. Are you going to ask the next question?
uid016c00b1.msg:006b:0x0000D5CE:0750:110=Yes, and it's the last one. So if you don't mess up here, you'll be getting a real big donation. Good luck!
uid016c00b1.msg:0024:0x0000D63A:075c:111=Yes, I'm counting on you, Saito-kun!
uid016c00b1.msg:002a:0x0000D660:0774:112=The United States of America. I'm certain.
uid016c00b1.msg:0025:0x0000D68B:0780:113=The United States? Is that really it?
uid016c00b1.msg:0042:0x0000D6B1:078c:114=That's right. It's the country that sent the Black Ships to Japan.
uid016c00b1.msg:0038:0x0000D6F4:0798:115=Oh my, to be honest I didn't know it was so close to us.
uid016c00b1.msg:0021:0x0000D72D:07a4:116=Please, stop playing around here!
uid016c00b1.msg:0008:0x0000D74F:07b0:117=What...?
uid016c00b1.msg:005f:0x0000D758:07bc:118=The United States of America is far, far away! The country Omitsu pointed at is the Great Qing!
uid016c00b1.msg:0028:0x0000D7B9:07d4:119=That's Britain. There's no mistaking it.
uid016c00b1.msg:0020:0x0000D7E2:07e0:120=Really? You sure that's Britain?
uid016c00b1.msg:000a:0x0000D803:07ec:121=Of course.
uid016c00b1.msg:0037:0x0000D80E:07f8:122=Oh... Goodness, I didn't know it was so close to Japan.
uid016c00b1.msg:001e:0x0000D846:0804:123=Please, enough with the jokes!
uid016c00b1.msg:0005:0x0000D865:0810:124=What?
uid016c00b1.msg:0052:0x0000D86B:081c:125=Britain is nowhere close to here! The country Omitsu pointed at is the Great Qing!
uid016c00b1.msg:0043:0x0000D8BF:0834:126=Don't you know this globe represents the whole world, Saito-sensei?
uid016c00b1.msg:0065:0x0000D903:0840:127=And as you can see, Japan is much, much smaller and the world is much, much bigger than we thought...
uid016c00b1.msg:008a:0x0000D969:084c:128=And there's also a country that's taking over the world really fast... That would be Great Britain! It's an island nation just like Japan.
uid016c00b1.msg:0027:0x0000D9F4:0858:129=Can you tell us where Great Britain is?
uid016c00b1.msg:0035:0x0000DA1C:0864:130=Um... So what, you're just asking me to point it out?
uid016c00b1.msg:0060:0x0000DA52:0870:131=Yeah, it might be a threat to our country some day. So we should know about it, don't you think?
uid016c00b1.msg:003b:0x0000DAB5:0894:132=What're you waiting for, Saito-sensei? Tell us where it is.
uid016c00b1.msg:0029:0x0000DAF3:08b8:133=This country right here is Great Britain.
uid016c00b1.msg:0056:0x0000DB1D:08c4:134=Are you sure? Really, really sure? I thought I just said Britain was an island nation.
uid016c00b1.msg:0031:0x0000DB74:08d0:135=(Hm. Starting to think that's not it, after all.)
uid016c00b1.msg:001f:0x0000DBA6:08dc:136=Hold on. Let me think about it.
uid016c00b1.msg:0047:0x0000DBC6:08e8:137=Fine with me. Just so you know, the country you pointed out is Holland.
uid016c00b1.msg:0093:0x0000DC0E:08f4:138=It is? Holland and the Great Qing were two of the only nations Japan was allowed to trade with, back when it was closed to the world by the Bakufu.
uid016c00b1.msg:0029:0x0000DCA2:0900:139=That's right, Sensei! You do know things.
uid016c00b1.msg:0027:0x0000DCCC:090c:140=Heh. Well, that one's common knowledge.
uid016c00b1.msg:0038:0x0000DCF5:0924:141=All right, Saito-sensei. Tell us where Great Britain is!
uid016c00b1.msg:0024:0x0000DD31:0954:142=Great Britain? It's right over here.
uid016c00b1.msg:0039:0x0000DD56:0960:143=Um, Saito-sensei... We <i>just</i> said that one's Japan.
uid016c00b1.msg:002d:0x0000DD90:096c:144=O-Oh, right. Sorry, my hand slipped just now.
uid016c00b1.msg:0051:0x0000DDBE:0978:145=Hey, are you okay, Saito-kun!? We're counting on you for this donation, you know!
uid016c00b1.msg:002f:0x0000DE10:0984:146=I know, I know. Everything's fine, don't worry.
uid016c00b1.msg:006c:0x0000DE41:099c:147=All right, Saito-sensei. Well, please make sure your hand doesn't... slip again. Just show us Great Britain!
uid016c00b1.msg:002a:0x0000DEB1:09cc:148=This looks like it could be Great Britain.
uid016c00b1.msg:0015:0x0000DEDC:09d8:149=Really? Are you sure?
uid016c00b1.msg:002d:0x0000DEF2:09e4:150=(Uh... Seems like that's not right, I guess.)
uid016c00b1.msg:0027:0x0000DF20:09f0:151=Just a moment. Let me think about this.
uid016c00b1.msg:004d:0x0000DF48:09fc:152=Sure. By the way, the country you pointed at is the United States of America.
uid016c00b1.msg:0059:0x0000DF96:0a08:153=Oh, so that's the U.S. You know, they're the ones who sent over the Black Ships to Japan!
uid016c00b1.msg:0038:0x0000DFF0:0a14:154=Yes. Very true, Sensei. So you do know things after all!
uid016c00b1.msg:001d:0x0000E029:0a20:155=Heh. Oh, everyone knows that.
uid016c00b1.msg:003b:0x0000E048:0a38:156=Well come on, Saito-sensei. Tell us where Great Britain is!
uid016c00b1.msg:002e:0x0000E087:0a68:157=If I know my maps, Great Britain's right here.
uid016c00b1.msg:002b:0x0000E0B6:0a74:158=W-Wait, Saito-kun! You said that was Japan!
uid016c00b1.msg:0028:0x0000E0E3:0a8c:159=Here's where those British dandies live.
uid016c00b1.msg:005c:0x0000E10C:0a98:160=Um, Saito-kun. We just heard that Britain is an island nation. So... are you sure that's it?
uid016c00b1.msg:0034:0x0000E169:0aa4:161=Not even close. That's the United States of America.
uid016c00b1.msg:0015:0x0000E19F:0abc:162=Britain's right here.
uid016c00b1.msg:005c:0x0000E1B5:0ac8:163=Um, Saito-kun. We just heard that Britain is an island nation. So... are you sure that's it?
uid016c00b1.msg:001f:0x0000E212:0ad4:164=Not even close. That's Holland.
uid016c00b1.msg:0014:0x0000E232:0ae0:165=Oh... Is it, really?
uid016c00b1.msg:003b:0x0000E247:0aec:166=Y-Your hand must have slipped. Isn't that right, Saito-kun?
uid016c00b1.msg:001a:0x0000E283:0af8:167=Please, stop being stupid!
uid016c00b1.msg:0008:0x0000E29E:0b04:168=What...?
uid016c00b1.msg:0083:0x0000E2A7:0b10:169=I was right. This school isn't a good place for me. How could I ever succeed here, with teachers like you two? I'm quitting. Today!
uid016c00b1.msg:0021:0x0000E32B:0b1c:170=Wait! What about the donation...?
uid016c00b1.msg:0080:0x0000E34D:0b28:171=Why would my family make a donation!? You're even dumber than I thought you were when I saw you struggling with those questions!
uid016c00b1.msg:0019:0x0000E3CE:0b34:172=Well, you see, this is...
uid016c00b1.msg:0044:0x0000E3E8:0b40:173=I mean really, if you don't know something, just say you don't know!
uid016c00b1.msg:0050:0x0000E42D:0b4c:174=There are way too many grown-ups who pretend to know everything! I'm sick of it!
uid016c00b1.msg:006d:0x0000E47E:0b58:175=It's like they're okay with us kids looking like idiots! Why else would they teach us the wrong information!?
uid016c00b1.msg:0040:0x0000E4EC:0b64:176=Oh... No, of course I don't want that. I'm sorry... I was wrong.
uid016c00b1.msg:0054:0x0000E52D:0b70:177=It's fine, whatever. It's just... I really am sad it had to end like this, Sensei...
uid016c00b1.msg:004c:0x0000E582:0b7c:178=The Great Qing!? Um, maybe you're talking about the great "king" of Britain?
uid016c00b1.msg:0081:0x0000E5CF:0b88:179=You can't trick me with wordplay! It's obvious this school isn't providing me with a real education. I won't be coming back here!
uid016c00b1.msg:0025:0x0000E651:0b94:180=Wh-What!? What about the donation...?
uid016c00b1.msg:0075:0x0000E677:0ba0:181=There's not going to be a donation! Do you think my dad is as dumb as you? I can't believe you're running this place.
uid016c00b1.msg:0019:0x0000E6ED:0bac:182=Well, this is all very...
uid016c00b1.msg:0043:0x0000E707:0bb8:183=If you don't know something, all you have to say is you don't know.

uid016c00b1.msg:0054:0x0000E84B:0be8:187=It's fine, whatever. It's just... I really am sad it had to end like this, Sensei...
uid016c00b1.msg:0023:0x0000E8A4:0c24:188=This one's Britain—I can feel it.
uid016c00b1.msg:0020:0x0000E8C8:0c30:189=Really? Are you sure about that?
uid016c00b1.msg:0051:0x0000E8E9:0c3c:190=Hey, are you okay, Saito-kun!? We're counting on you for this donation, you know!
uid016c00b1.msg:002f:0x0000E93B:0c48:191=I know, I know. Everything's fine, don't worry.
uid016c00b1.msg:0022:0x0000E96B:0c54:192=Okay. You seem pretty confident...
uid016c00b1.msg:000d:0x0000E98E:0c60:193=Because I am.
uid016c00b1.msg:0095:0x0000E99D:0c78:194=You got me, Saito-sensei! You're totally right, that is definitely Great Britain. More specifically, The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland!
uid016c00b1.msg:0039:0x0000EA33:0c84:195=Oh, thank goodness! You did it, Saito-kun! Oh, lucky day!
uid016c00b1.msg:005b:0x0000EA6D:0c90:196=Saito-sensei, I want to say I'm sorry for being so rude. That's not how my dad raised me...
uid016c00b1.msg:0003:0x0000EAC9:0c9c:197=Oh?
uid016c00b1.msg:0047:0x0000EACD:0ca8:198=No, it really isn't. I just wanted so bad to test you... I didn't care.
uid016c00b1.msg:0011:0x0000EB15:0cb4:199=But why, exactly?
uid016c00b1.msg:0069:0x0000EB27:0cc0:200=I really, really wanted to find out what's going on in Japan right now. What's going on for real, I mean.
uid016c00b1.msg:0083:0x0000EB91:0ccc:201=Us kids can't figure out which grown-ups are right: the ones who support the Bakufu, or the loyalists who stand behind the Emperor.
uid016c00b1.msg:007c:0x0000EC15:0cd8:202=I just wanted to be taught by someone who knows where Japan is, at least. That's why I brought the globe in the first place.
uid016c00b1.msg:0029:0x0000EC92:0ce4:203=Wow... So that's what this was all about.
uid016c00b1.msg:0089:0x0000ECBC:0cf0:204=But now I know that here at this school, I can actually learn things. I'm grateful for teachers like you! I want you to keep teaching me!
uid016c00b1.msg:001f:0x0000ED47:0d08:205=Oh... This is really something.
uid016c00b1.msg:0070:0x0000ED6E:0d20:206=Saito-kun, I think I'm making a big mistake, just to protect my own self-image. I must correct that mistake now.
uid016c00b1.msg:0020:0x0000EDDF:0d2c:207=Huh? What are you talking about?
uid016c00b1.msg:0033:0x0000EE00:0d38:208=Children. It is I who should be apologizing to you.
uid016c00b1.msg:0077:0x0000EE34:0d44:209=Saito-kun here understands this globe. But as for me... I have to confess to all of you, I do not understand it at all.
uid016c00b1.msg:002b:0x0000EEAC:0d50:210=Wait! Is Saito-sensei not your apprentice!?
uid016c00b1.msg:0070:0x0000EED8:0d5c:211=No. No, he isn't. I just bumped into him, and he told me he understands globes, so I asked him to come in today.
uid016c00b1.msg:005e:0x0000EF50:0d74:212=I'm sorry, children. Instead of being honest with you, I have shamelessly betrayed your trust!
uid016c00b1.msg:0010:0x0000EFAF:0d80:213=Is that right...
uid016c00b1.msg:006c:0x0000EFC0:0d8c:214=I'm truly sorry. And as such, this will be our final farewell. Clearly, I have no right to teach any of you.
uid016c00b1.msg:0069:0x0000F02D:0d98:215=No, Sensei. It's my fault. I was too quick to assume that knowledge is more important than anything else.
uid016c00b1.msg:0027:0x0000F097:0da4:216=That's... quite a reversal I'm hearing.
uid016c00b1.msg:0073:0x0000F0BF:0db0:217=I'm saying this because you could have stood there and said nothing. But instead, you decided to be honest with us.
uid016c00b1.msg:0063:0x0000F133:0dbc:218=It reminded me of something my dad said once—he said learning isn't just about gaining knowledge.
uid016c00b1.msg:0056:0x0000F197:0dc8:219=He said the most important thing is to show our descendants what it means to do right.
uid016c00b1.msg:0077:0x0000F1EE:0dd4:220=Sensei, now I want to learn from you even more. I think that not only are you a good teacher, you're a good role model!
uid016c00b1.msg:0032:0x0000F266:0de0:221=And you're even willing to keep calling me sensei?
uid016c00b1.msg:000c:0x0000F299:0dec:222=Yes, Sensei!
uid016c00b1.msg:0012:0x0000F2A6:0df8:223=Of course, Sensei!
uid016c00b1.msg:0018:0x0000F2B9:0e04:224=You're the best, Sensei!

uid016c00bc.msg:0018:0x00000CDF:00a8:2=What's behind this door?
uid016c00bc.msg:0061:0x00000CF8:00b4:3=That's the bath. You're welcome to it whenever you'd like. Just ask, and I'll heat it up for you.
uid016c00bc.msg:004c:0x00000D5A:00c0:4=Also, please feel free to use the living room and futon if you need a rest.

uid016c00be.msg:0009:0x00002B90:0094:5=Mm, sure.
uid016c00be.msg:0059:0x00002B9C:00b8:6=*sigh* That's good. It's hard to reach behind me. This beats stretching—by a long shot.
uid016c00be.msg:003d:0x00002BF6:00c4:7=I'm glad. Uncle Hajime, let me know if you get an itch, okay?
uid016c00be.msg:0043:0x00002C38:0100:8=That's more than fine. I feel totally refreshed. Thank you, Haruka.
uid016c00be.msg:0021:0x00002C7C:010c:9=Haha, great. You're very welcome!
uid016c00be.msg:001e:0x00002CA6:0178:10=(Mmm, the water's just right.)

uid016c00be.msg:005c:0x00002EA5:02b0:22=You work up such a sweat every day, it's important to stay clean. Want me to wash your back?

uid016c00be.msg:0059:0x00002F0E:02e0:24=*sigh* That's good. It's hard to reach behind me. This beats stretching—by a long shot.
uid016c00be.msg:0025:0x00002F68:02ec:25=Ah... Too much back, not enough arms.
uid016c00be.msg:0048:0x00002F8E:02f8:26=You said it. You've got a lot of back to cover. Actually, so did my dad.
uid016c00be.msg:003b:0x00002FD7:0304:27=Your father did too, huh? Did you wash his for him as well?
uid016c00be.msg:0030:0x00003013:0310:28=Mm. When I was little, we'd take baths together.
uid016c00be.msg:006d:0x00003044:031c:29=Whenever I cleaned his back, it made him happy. He would say, "Thank you very much." So, I was glad to do it.
uid016c00be.msg:0063:0x000030B2:0328:30=We stopped doing that as I got older, though, bathing together. It seemed right at the time, but...
uid016c00be.msg:0026:0x00003116:0334:31=What was he like, Haruka? Your father?
uid016c00be.msg:0073:0x0000313D:0340:32=Hmm... He was kind of quiet, and straightforward. But, he was never cruel. Actually, Uncle Hajime, you're like him.
uid016c00be.msg:0011:0x000031B1:034c:33=Oh. You think so?
uid016c00be.msg:0065:0x000031C3:0358:34=Mm. When I was little, my father was the strongest man in the world, I thought. He could do anything.
uid016c00be.msg:0071:0x00003229:0364:35=That's really sweet. I've never imagined having children, but... if I did, I'd like them to think the same of me.
uid016c00be.msg:0015:0x0000329B:0370:36=You—You would, huh?
uid016c00be.msg:0066:0x000032B1:037c:37=Yeah, I'm sure of it. Your father must've been very grateful for that, Haruka, in the time you shared.
uid016c00be.msg:0084:0x0000331F:0394:38=We... We can't ever bring back the dead. All we can do for them... is find a way to live that would make them proud of us. You know?
uid016c00be.msg:0010:0x000033A4:03a0:39=Mm. That's true.
uid016c00be.msg:0089:0x000033B5:03ac:40=I want... Mom and Dad to see me living well. Doing my best, in our home. I want this place to be... everything it was when it was theirs.
uid016c00be.msg:003b:0x0000343F:03b8:41=Haruka... I don't think you've got anything to worry about.
uid016c00be.msg:0036:0x0000348A:0430:42=(Mm, the water's just right. I've never felt cleaner.)

uid016c00c1.msg:002c:0x00004E21:00c0:3=Okay! What time do you think you'll be back?
uid016c00c1.msg:0024:0x00004E4E:00cc:4=I'm not really sure today, actually.
uid016c00c1.msg:0073:0x00004E73:00d8:5=Well, be careful, Uncle Hajime. People always come up to you out of nowhere and pull you into the strangest things!
uid016c00c1.msg:0046:0x00004EE7:00e4:6=Don't worry, I'm sure that won't happen again. I'll be fine. Probably.

uid016c00c1.msg:002a:0x00004F8B:0108:9=Should I draw a bath, before you get home?
uid016c00c1.msg:001f:0x00004FB6:0114:10=It'll be late tonight, I think.
uid016c00c1.msg:003b:0x00004FD6:0120:11=Then I bet you'll appreciate a warm bath when you get home!
uid016c00c1.msg:001b:0x00005012:012c:12=Hm. Yeah, that sounds nice.

uid016c00c1.msg:0016:0x000059C0:0510:67=Um, wh-what's no good?
uid016c00c1.msg:006e:0x000059D7:051c:68=Haruka, we're sharing a roof together. You don't have to be so formal. How about... treating me like a friend?

uid016c00c1.msg:0049:0x00005A70:0534:70=Hmm... That too. Calling me Saito-san like I'm your boss isn't necessary.
uid016c00c1.msg:0036:0x00005ABA:0540:71=Eh? O-Of course. So then, what should I call you, sir?
uid016c00c1.msg:000c:0x00005AF1:054c:72=Let's see...
uid016c00c1.msg:0019:0x00005AFE:0558:73=Sa-chan. Like we're pals.
uid016c00c1.msg:0050:0x00005B18:0564:74=Sa—Sa-chan? Um... Don't take this the wrong way, but... it's awfully friendly.
uid016c00c1.msg:0054:0x00005B69:0570:75=You're right. It sounded off as soon as I said it. Forget that one, let's go with...
uid016c00c1.msg:001d:0x00005BBE:057c:76=Hajime-chan. That seems nice.
uid016c00c1.msg:0058:0x00005BDC:0588:77=Ha—Hajime-chan? I don't know, if I'm being honest. You'd sound like my little brother.
uid016c00c1.msg:002c:0x00005C35:0594:78=Oh. Well, that's awkward. What's that leave?
uid016c00c1.msg:0062:0x00005C62:05a0:79=I guess it's presumptuous to come up with a nickname on the spot. For now, just... call me Hajime.

uid016c00c1.msg:006e:0x00005D0B:05b8:81=*sigh* Have it your way. I do have an uncle's face. Just hoped I'd be... a little older before people said so.

uid016c00c2.msg:0054:0x000052C8:01f8:27=I'm sorry that it isn't much... If you don't want it, it's okay if you throw it out.
uid016c00c2.msg:001d:0x0000531D:0204:28=No, it looks good. Thank you.
uid016c00c2.msg:000d:0x0000533B:0210:29=Eh... Haha...
uid016c00c2.msg:001c:0x00005349:021c:30=All right, then. Time to go.
uid016c00c2.msg:0022:0x00005366:0228:31=Mm! Have a good day, Uncle Hajime!
uid016c00c2.msg:001b:0x00005393:02ac:32=(Right. Time to get going.)
uid016c00c2.msg:001c:0x000053B1:02d0:33=Ah, Haruka, I'm leaving now.
uid016c00c2.msg:002c:0x000053CE:02dc:34=Okay! What time do you think you'll be back?
uid016c00c2.msg:0024:0x000053FB:02e8:35=I'm not really sure today, actually.
uid016c00c2.msg:0073:0x00005420:02f4:36=Well, be careful, Uncle Hajime. People always come up to you out of nowhere and pull you into the strangest things!
uid016c00c2.msg:0046:0x00005494:0300:37=Don't worry, I'm sure that won't happen again. I'll be fine. Probably.
uid016c00c2.msg:004a:0x000054DB:030c:38=Haha, if you say so! Be sure to take care of yourself, okay? See you soon.
uid016c00c2.msg:0011:0x00005526:0318:39=See you soon too.
uid016c00c2.msg:002a:0x00005538:0324:40=Should I draw a bath, before you get home?
uid016c00c2.msg:001f:0x00005563:0330:41=It'll be late tonight, I think.
uid016c00c2.msg:003b:0x00005583:033c:42=Then I bet you'll appreciate a warm bath when you get home!
uid016c00c2.msg:001b:0x000055BF:0348:43=Hm. Yeah, that sounds nice.
uid016c00c2.msg:0073:0x000055DB:0354:44=Well, be careful, Uncle Hajime. People always come up to you out of nowhere and pull you into the strangest things!

uid016c00c2.msg:0023:0x000056F3:0384:48=I shouldn't be long, I don't think.
uid016c00c2.msg:0032:0x00005717:0390:49=Oh, really? Will you want a bath when you're home?
uid016c00c2.msg:0015:0x0000574A:039c:50=Mm, that sounds nice.
uid016c00c2.msg:001f:0x00005760:03a8:51=Okay! It'll be waiting for you.

uid016c00c2.msg:0019:0x00005788:03c0:53=No, don't worry about it.
uid016c00c2.msg:006a:0x000057A2:03cc:54=You're sure? You always seem so worn out when you come back... I think I'll draw one anyway, just in case.
uid016c00c2.msg:000f:0x0000580D:03d8:55=Heh. All right.
uid016c00c2.msg:0022:0x0000581D:03e4:56=Oh, Uncle Hajime, take this too...

uid016c00c2.msg:002d:0x0000597B:04f8:65=Oh. Okay, sir. I hope you... have a good day.
uid016c00c2.msg:0016:0x000059A9:0504:66=Hmm... That's no good.
uid016c00c2.msg:0016:0x000059C0:0510:67=Um, wh-what's no good?
uid016c00c2.msg:006e:0x000059D7:051c:68=Haruka, we're sharing a roof together. You don't have to be so formal. How about... treating me like a friend?
uid016c00c2.msg:0029:0x00005A46:0528:69=Oh. Of course... I'll do that, Saito-san.
uid016c00c2.msg:0049:0x00005A70:0534:70=Hmm... That too. Calling me Saito-san like I'm your boss isn't necessary.
uid016c00c2.msg:0036:0x00005ABA:0540:71=Eh? O-Of course. So then, what should I call you, sir?
uid016c00c2.msg:000c:0x00005AF1:054c:72=Let's see...
uid016c00c2.msg:0019:0x00005AFE:0558:73=Sa-chan. Like we're pals.
uid016c00c2.msg:0050:0x00005B18:0564:74=Sa—Sa-chan? Um... Don't take this the wrong way, but... it's awfully friendly.
uid016c00c2.msg:0054:0x00005B69:0570:75=You're right. It sounded off as soon as I said it. Forget that one, let's go with...
uid016c00c2.msg:001d:0x00005BBE:057c:76=Hajime-chan. That seems nice.
uid016c00c2.msg:0058:0x00005BDC:0588:77=Ha—Hajime-chan? I don't know, if I'm being honest. You'd sound like my little brother.
uid016c00c2.msg:002c:0x00005C35:0594:78=Oh. Well, that's awkward. What's that leave?
uid016c00c2.msg:0062:0x00005C62:05a0:79=I guess it's presumptuous to come up with a nickname on the spot. For now, just... call me Hajime.
uid016c00c2.msg:0045:0x00005CC5:05ac:80=Hajime? Almost... How about one step further, though... Uncle Hajime?
uid016c00c2.msg:006e:0x00005D0B:05b8:81=*sigh* Have it your way. I do have an uncle's face. Just hoped I'd be... a little older before people said so.
uid016c00c2.msg:0023:0x00005D7A:05c4:82=Oh, I'm sorry. That was rude of me.
uid016c00c2.msg:0053:0x00005D9E:05d0:83=No, I got us into this—not you. I'm happy with Uncle Hajime. So then, we're good?
uid016c00c2.msg:001e:0x00005DF2:05dc:84=Yes! I like the sound of that.
uid016c00c2.msg:0046:0x00005E11:05e8:85=That's what matters. I'll be on my way for now, then. So... take care.
uid016c00c2.msg:000a:0x00005E58:05f4:86=Okay, sir!
uid016c00c2.msg:0020:0x00005E63:0600:87=Not "okay, sir"... "Okay." Okay?
uid016c00c2.msg:0024:0x00005E84:060c:88=Okay! Have a good day, Uncle Hajime!

uid016c00c3.msg:0022:0x000048D7:00dc:5=Haruka, want to come rest with me?

uid016c00c3.msg:0037:0x00004906:00f4:7=Yeah. You look like you could use the shuteye. Join me.
uid016c00c3.msg:0005:0x0000493E:0100:8=Okay!
uid016c00c3.msg:001c:0x00004949:0148:9=Uncle Hajime? Are you awake?
uid016c00c3.msg:0010:0x00004966:0154:10=Yeah. What's up?
uid016c00c3.msg:0069:0x00004977:0160:11=Um, I don't know. I'm just... thinking. Ever since you first started living here, I've been really happy.
uid016c00c3.msg:0020:0x000049E1:016c:12=Have you? I'm glad to hear that.
uid016c00c3.msg:0019:0x00004A02:0178:13=Mm. You're a good person.

uid016c00c3.msg:0055:0x00004A22:0190:15=Mm. It's hard to say it during the day, while we're working. Thank you, Uncle Hajime.
uid016c00c3.msg:0045:0x00004A78:019c:16=Haruka... Heh. You're very kind. Thank you too. Now, we should sleep.

uid016c00c3.msg:003c:0x00004DFA:0430:40=Huh? Oh, um... I'm fine. I was just up pretty late cleaning.
uid016c00c3.msg:002d:0x00004E37:043c:41=Hm. Why don't I pull out a futon for you too?
uid016c00c3.msg:0011:0x00004E65:0448:42=Um, are you sure?
uid016c00c3.msg:007c:0x00004E77:0454:43=You do such a good job of caring for this place, but caring for yourself is important too. If you're tired, you should rest.
uid016c00c3.msg:0023:0x00004EF4:0460:44=Come on. Let's both get some sleep.
uid016c00c3.msg:0005:0x00004F18:046c:45=Okay.
uid016c00c3.msg:001d:0x00004F23:04b4:46=Uncle Hajime? Are you asleep?
uid016c00c3.msg:001f:0x00004F41:04c0:47=No, not yet... Something wrong?
uid016c00c3.msg:0059:0x00004F61:04cc:48=Mm-mm. It's funny, I was sleepy before. For some reason now, though... I feel wide awake.
uid016c00c3.msg:0047:0x00004FBB:04d8:49=Hey, Uncle Hajime. Do you ever feel like... the world's a lonely place?
uid016c00c3.msg:006f:0x00005003:04e4:50=Sometimes I do. When you're out, I think... "Haruka, come home soon, yeah? The house is too empty without you."
uid016c00c3.msg:0013:0x00005073:04f0:51=Y-You do? Hahaha...
uid016c00c3.msg:008f:0x00005087:04fc:52=You know, I've never done that before—waited for someone. Until now, I don't think I really knew what loneliness is. You changed that for me.
uid016c00c3.msg:0016:0x00005117:0508:53=Huh? What do you mean?
uid016c00c3.msg:0006:0x0000512E:0514:54=Never.
uid016c00c3.msg:0020:0x00005135:0520:55=I see. Why's that, Uncle Hajime?
uid016c00c3.msg:0028:0x00005156:052c:56=Haruka, you're why. You're good company.
uid016c00c3.msg:000f:0x0000517F:0538:57=I am? Hahaha...
uid016c00c3.msg:0040:0x0000518F:0544:58=But, even before I met you, I think... I never felt very lonely.
uid016c00c3.msg:0015:0x000051D0:0550:59=Oh? What do you mean?
uid016c00c3.msg:0019:0x000051E6:055c:60=I'm used to it, actually.
uid016c00c3.msg:0015:0x00005200:0568:61=Oh? What do you mean?
uid016c00c3.msg:0081:0x00005216:0574:62=I lost my family when I was young. After that, loneliness wasn't something I ever noticed. The pain I carried just seemed normal.
uid016c00c3.msg:002e:0x00005298:0580:63=But now, I realize I'd just gotten used to it.
uid016c00c3.msg:0022:0x000052C7:058c:64=You couldn't tell... that it hurt?
uid016c00c3.msg:008c:0x000052EA:0598:65=Ah. Looking back on it... I'm not sure how it was I stayed standing. But, after a certain stretch of time, I became numb. The pain was gone.
uid016c00c3.msg:006a:0x00005377:05a4:66=I get it. Once loneliness becomes normal for you, it gets harder and harder to tell that it's still there.
uid016c00c3.msg:003f:0x000053E2:05b0:67=If I had never met you... I think I'd have become the same way.
uid016c00c3.msg:0066:0x00005422:05bc:68=Well, who can say? It's just... you've changed things for me. Living here with you has opened my eyes.
uid016c00c3.msg:0083:0x00005489:05c8:69=It's good to share a home. Even if I miss you when we're apart... it's all right. Because I know we'll be together—like a family.
uid016c00c3.msg:001a:0x0000550D:05d4:70=A... A family? You and me?
uid016c00c3.msg:0050:0x00005528:05e0:71=Yeah. I know it all happened unusually... but it's as much a family as I've had.
uid016c00c3.msg:0045:0x00005579:05ec:72=So if you're sad, or you feel lonely, come tell me. I'm here for you.
uid016c00c3.msg:0055:0x000055BF:05f8:73=Anything you need. Whatever I can do... I'll do it for you. You and me, we're family.
uid016c00c3.msg:0020:0x00005615:0604:74=Uncle Hajime... Haha, thank you.
uid016c00c3.msg:0033:0x00005636:0610:75=Well, I'm pretty tired now. And you? Can you sleep?
uid016c00c3.msg:001c:0x0000566A:061c:76=Mm. Goodnight, Uncle Hajime.
uid016c00c3.msg:0012:0x00005687:0628:77=Goodnight, Haruka.
uid016c00c3.msg:001a:0x000056A2:0694:78=(Mm, ready to lie down...)
uid016c00c3.msg:0017:0x000056BD:06a0:79=(Hm, more to do first.)
uid016c00c4.msg:0036:0x0000490C:0058:1=(I've been working hard. Maybe I should take a break.)
uid016c00c4.msg:003c:0x0000494B:00c4:2=Oh! I know, Uncle Hajime. Why don't I clean your ears again?
uid016c00c4.msg:001a:0x00004988:00d0:3=Thanks, but not right now.
uid016c00c4.msg:001c:0x000049A3:00dc:4=Really? Well, if you say so.
uid016c00c4.msg:0012:0x000049C7:013c:5=Ah, I'd like that.
uid016c00c4.msg:000f:0x000049DA:0148:6=Okay! Let's go.
uid016c00c4.msg:0047:0x000049EE:0184:7=Okaaay, how are they looking? Oh, you definitely need another cleaning.
uid016c00c4.msg:0005:0x00004A36:0190:8=Hngh!
uid016c00c4.msg:0028:0x00004A3C:019c:9=Ah, and some more right there... Got it.
uid016c00c4.msg:000c:0x00004A65:01a8:10=Guaaah—ha!
uid016c00c4.msg:0026:0x00004A72:01b4:11=Oh! I'm sorry! Did I... go too far in?
uid016c00c4.msg:0020:0x00004A99:01c0:12=A-Ahhh... A bit. It's all right.
uid016c00c4.msg:0031:0x00004ABE:01fc:13=*sigh* That feels much better. Thank you, Haruka.
uid016c00c4.msg:001a:0x00004AF0:0208:14=Haha! You're very welcome.

uid016c00c7.msg:003d:0x00002DA3:01d8:16=I'm glad. Uncle Hajime, let me know if you get an itch, okay?
uid016c00c7.msg:0043:0x00002DE5:0214:17=That's more than fine. I feel totally refreshed. Thank you, Haruka.
uid016c00c7.msg:0021:0x00002E29:0220:18=Haha, great. You're very welcome!
uid016c00c7.msg:001e:0x00002E53:028c:19=(Mmm, the water's just right.)
uid016c00c7.msg:0018:0x00002E72:0298:20=How is it, Uncle Hajime?
uid016c00c7.msg:0019:0x00002E8B:02a4:21=Ah. It's nice, thank you.
uid016c00c7.msg:005c:0x00002EA5:02b0:22=You work up such a sweat every day, it's important to stay clean. Want me to wash your back?
uid016c00c7.msg:0009:0x00002F02:02bc:23=Mm, sure.
uid016c00c7.msg:0059:0x00002F0E:02e0:24=*sigh* That's good. It's hard to reach behind me. This beats stretching—by a long shot.
uid016c00c7.msg:0025:0x00002F68:02ec:25=Ah... Too much back, not enough arms.
uid016c00c7.msg:0048:0x00002F8E:02f8:26=You said it. You've got a lot of back to cover. Actually, so did my dad.
uid016c00c7.msg:003b:0x00002FD7:0304:27=Your father did too, huh? Did you wash his for him as well?
uid016c00c7.msg:0030:0x00003013:0310:28=Mm. When I was little, we'd take baths together.
uid016c00c7.msg:006d:0x00003044:031c:29=Whenever I cleaned his back, it made him happy. He would say, "Thank you very much." So, I was glad to do it.
uid016c00c7.msg:0063:0x000030B2:0328:30=We stopped doing that as I got older, though, bathing together. It seemed right at the time, but...
uid016c00c7.msg:0026:0x00003116:0334:31=What was he like, Haruka? Your father?
uid016c00c7.msg:0073:0x0000313D:0340:32=Hmm... He was kind of quiet, and straightforward. But, he was never cruel. Actually, Uncle Hajime, you're like him.
uid016c00c7.msg:0011:0x000031B1:034c:33=Oh. You think so?
uid016c00c7.msg:0065:0x000031C3:0358:34=Mm. When I was little, my father was the strongest man in the world, I thought. He could do anything.
uid016c00c7.msg:0071:0x00003229:0364:35=That's really sweet. I've never imagined having children, but... if I did, I'd like them to think the same of me.
uid016c00c7.msg:0015:0x0000329B:0370:36=You—You would, huh?
uid016c00c7.msg:0066:0x000032B1:037c:37=Yeah, I'm sure of it. Your father must've been very grateful for that, Haruka, in the time you shared.
uid016c00c7.msg:0084:0x0000331F:0394:38=We... We can't ever bring back the dead. All we can do for them... is find a way to live that would make them proud of us. You know?
uid016c00c7.msg:0010:0x000033A4:03a0:39=Mm. That's true.
uid016c00c7.msg:0089:0x000033B5:03ac:40=I want... Mom and Dad to see me living well. Doing my best, in our home. I want this place to be... everything it was when it was theirs.
uid016c00c7.msg:003b:0x0000343F:03b8:41=Haruka... I don't think you've got anything to worry about.
uid016c00c7.msg:0036:0x0000348A:0430:42=(Mm, the water's just right. I've never felt cleaner.)
uid016c00d3.msg:0049:0x00000AAB:005c:1=Oh! You came. I've been waiting for you. Oh, I'm so happy... Truly, I am!
uid016c00d3.msg:0028:0x00000AF5:0068:2=Heh, you say that to all your customers?
uid016c00d3.msg:0041:0x00000B1E:0074:3=Not at all! You're the only one who's this special to me. Honest.
uid016c00d3.msg:0022:0x00000B60:0080:4=Yeah? Well, that's nice to hear...
uid016c00d3.msg:003b:0x00000B83:008c:5=Ah, you don't believe me do you? Fine. Then, to prove it...
uid016c00d3.msg:0045:0x00000BC2:00bc:6=I've opened up the Sensual Healing: Super Asura course, just for you.
uid016c00d3.msg:0045:0x00000C0B:00ec:7=It's for your eyes only, all right? So? Does this convey my feelings?
uid016c00d3.msg:0016:0x00000C51:00f8:8=Heh, yeah. Definitely.
uid016c00d3.msg:002c:0x00000C68:0104:9=Oh, I'm so glad! Hope to see you again, sir!
uid016c00f1.msg:0055:0x000015BC:0028:1=Whatever will I do? Yes, we've always wanted one, but I have no idea how to use it...
uid016c00f1.msg:0028:0x00001613:0040:2=You having trouble with something there?
uid016c00f1.msg:0046:0x0000163C:004c:3=Huh? Well, um, it's just... I don't know how to properly read a globe.
uid016c00f1.msg:0008:0x00001683:0058:4=A globe?
uid016c00f1.msg:0088:0x0000168C:0064:5=That's right. You see, I run a private school, and just the other day, the parents of my students all chipped in to purchase this thing.
uid016c00f1.msg:0059:0x00001715:0070:6=And they want me to explain how to use it, so as to teach their children about the world.
uid016c00f1.msg:0045:0x0000176F:007c:7=A globe, huh... I remember my pops showing one to me a long time ago.
uid016c00f1.msg:003d:0x000017B5:0088:8=Really? So do you know how to read it, and find things on it?
uid016c00f1.msg:0023:0x000017F3:0094:9=All I said is I've seen one before.
uid016c00f1.msg:005b:0x00001817:00a0:10=Oh, but that's still so much better than my situation! I've never even seen one in my life!
uid016c00f1.msg:0076:0x00001873:00ac:11=I teach reading and writing, not cartography! I'm at a complete loss for how to satisfy all those expectant parents...
uid016c00f1.msg:0027:0x000018EA:00b8:12=Why don't you just be honest with them?
uid016c00f1.msg:0052:0x00001912:00c4:13=If only I could! But they bought this thing! Do you know how expensive a globe is?
uid016c00f1.msg:006a:0x00001965:00d0:14=I've built up a reputation over the years. These parents know me as the wise old man who knows everything.
uid016c00f1.msg:0064:0x000019D0:00dc:15=If I tell them I don't have the slightest idea how to use this, their generous gift becomes garbage!
uid016c00f1.msg:0018:0x00001A35:00e8:16=It is a tough situation.
uid016c00f1.msg:0057:0x00001A4E:00f4:17=The only plan I could come up with is to just pretend to know and bluff my way through.
uid016c00f1.msg:0082:0x00001AA6:0100:18=But then I thought, should I risk teaching wrong information in these times, when war with foreign powers might erupt any second!?
uid016c00f1.msg:008a:0x00001B29:010c:19=Accurate geographical data is vital. How could I ever forgive myself if the children's lives are ruined because they don't know geography?
uid016c00f1.msg:0033:0x00001BB4:0118:20=Such a dilemma I find myself in. What should I do!?
uid016c00f1.msg:0044:0x00001BE8:0124:21=Again, if you're that concerned about the kids, then just be honest.
uid016c00f1.msg:0022:0x00001C2D:0130:22=It'd be better than teaching lies.
uid016c00f1.msg:0049:0x00001C50:013c:23=But I will be so very embarrassed. Even worse, all my students may leave.
uid016c00f1.msg:0034:0x00001C9A:0148:24=Kind of sounds like all you want to do is save face.
uid016c00f1.msg:005d:0x00001CCF:0154:25=But wait, couldn't you come talk about the globe? Please, won't you save an old man's pride!?
uid016c00f1.msg:0049:0x00001D2D:0160:26=You're really asking some stranger to come explain things at your school?
uid016c00f1.msg:007d:0x00001D77:016c:27=Just the basics! All you have to cover is the locations of the major foreign countries which are currently threatening Japan!
uid016c00f1.msg:0036:0x00001DF5:0178:28=I beg of you! Won't you please think of the children!?
uid016c00f1.msg:003a:0x00001E2C:0184:29=Sorry, but I'm not going to teach these children nonsense.
uid016c00f1.msg:004c:0x00001E67:0190:30=Oh... okay. I shouldn't have asked. One can't expect help from a stranger...
uid016c00f1.msg:0023:0x00001EB8:01cc:31=All right, I'll do it for the kids.
uid016c00f1.msg:0035:0x00001EDC:01d8:32=Oh goodness, thank you so much! Please, do follow me.
uid016c0128.msg:0037:0x000018ED:0034:1=Saito-san, hello there. I've a letter addressed to you.
uid016c0128.msg:0011:0x00001927:0058:2=Ah, thanks... Hm?
uid016c0128.msg:002a:0x00001939:0064:3=I thought you were a courier. Who are you?
uid016c0128.msg:0041:0x00001964:0070:4=My apologies. I am Hirakawa, chief of the Black Panther Couriers.
uid016c0128.msg:000d:0x000019A6:007c:5=Their chief!?
uid016c0128.msg:005a:0x000019B4:0088:6=Yes. I believe you're acquainted with my team, having already dispatched Hoshi and Makino.
uid016c0128.msg:0054:0x00001A0F:0094:7=I didn't <i>dispatch</i> anyone. They issued a challenge and I accepted, that's all.
uid016c0128.msg:0052:0x00001A64:00a0:8=I see. Forgive me, I'm simply surprised that my couriers could lose to an amateur.
uid016c0128.msg:006a:0x00001AB7:00ac:9=Until now, we were known as the fastest in Kyo. You've brought no small amount of shame to our reputation.
uid016c0128.msg:0079:0x00001B22:00b8:10=Not that it's my concern, but weren't you trying to ruin your competitors' reputations? Seems like you reap what you sow.
uid016c0128.msg:003e:0x00001B9C:00c4:11=Hoho. You're a saucy one, Saito-san. I suppose you've a point.
uid016c0128.msg:0040:0x00001BDB:00d0:12=So, why are you here? This doesn't feel like a neighborly visit.
uid016c0128.msg:0044:0x00001C1C:00dc:13=Yes, well... Allow me to be blunt. I would like you to join my team.
uid016c0128.msg:001c:0x00001C61:00e8:14=You want me on the Panthers?
uid016c0128.msg:0034:0x00001C7E:00f4:15=Just so. As I said, our reputation has been damaged.
uid016c0128.msg:005c:0x00001CB3:0100:16=Rumor abounds of Kyo's new speedy deliveryman. Swifter even than the Black Panther Couriers.
uid016c0128.msg:0072:0x00001D10:010c:17=There are two ways of undoing this—outrace you, or make you one of us. Either way, we remain the fastest in Kyo.
uid016c0128.msg:0053:0x00001D83:0118:18=Right. If you recruit the upstart amateur, it's just one more win for the Panthers.
uid016c0128.msg:0013:0x00001DD7:0124:19=Hoho. Precisely so.
uid016c0128.msg:0066:0x00001DEB:0130:20=We provide a most generous salary. You would find it quite lavish, judging by the state of your abode.
uid016c0128.msg:006e:0x00001E52:013c:21=Sorry, but no. I never wanted to be a courier, and I can't say your way of doing business has changed my mind.
uid016c0128.msg:0005:0x00001EC1:0148:22=Hmph!
uid016c0128.msg:007d:0x00001EC7:0154:23=The Panthers are fast, but there's more to deliveries than that. Senders and recipients want their letters handled with care.
uid016c0128.msg:0082:0x00001F45:0160:24=Speed's not a bad quality, but heart matters just as much. I think as long you treat deliveries like a race, that will escape you.
uid016c0128.msg:004c:0x00001FC8:016c:25=I see. Well... the Black Panther Couriers appreciate your valuable feedback.
uid016c0128.msg:0061:0x00002015:0178:26=Nonetheless, you leave me with no choice but to crush you underfoot. For the sake of my business.
uid016c0128.msg:0011:0x00002078:0190:27=Delivery for you.
uid016c0128.msg:0016:0x0000208B:01a8:28=You received a letter.
uid016c0128.msg:000d:0x000020A2:01b4:29=What is this?
uid016c0128.msg:0038:0x000020B0:01c0:30=You'll understand once you read it. Farewell, Saito-san.
uid016c0128.msg:0015:0x000020EA:01d8:31=(Better take a look.)
uid016c0128.msg:00e4:0x00002100:01e4:32=This is Inamoto, the Black Panther Couriers' playmaker. If your feet are rested and prepared, let's have our match. I'll await you at the bridge near the gambling den in Rakugai. Once and for all, we'll see who's fastest in Kyo.
uid016c0128.msg:0056:0x000021E5:01f0:33=(So, a formal invitation. The bridge in Rakugai, huh? Might as well see this through.)
uid016c0129.msg:0024:0x00002949:0044:1=Th—This can't be! My calculations!
uid016c0129.msg:0023:0x0000296E:0050:2=No way... He even beat Inamoto-san.
uid016c0129.msg:001b:0x00002992:005c:3=This Saito guy is unreal...
uid016c0129.msg:001e:0x000029AE:0068:4=Explain yourself this instant.
uid016c0129.msg:0030:0x000029CF:008c:5=Chief! I... I must've made a mistake. I'm sorry.
uid016c0129.msg:0078:0x00002A00:0098:6=Not only must I watch you lose in disgrace, I'm to hear your pitiful excuses as well? You're fired. Get out of my sight.
uid016c0129.msg:005a:0x00002A79:00a4:7=But... we've worked together for so long. I've been with the Panthers since the beginning!
uid016c0129.msg:006f:0x00002AD4:00b0:8=Go drown that sentimental rubbish in the Kamo. Hoshi, Makino—you're both fired as well! You're all disgraces!
uid016c0129.msg:0015:0x00002B44:00bc:9=Eh!? Just like that!?
uid016c0129.msg:0006:0x00002B5A:00c8:10=Kck...
uid016c0129.msg:004b:0x00002B62:00e0:11=You impress me, Saito-san. How I wish you had accepted my offer to join us.
uid016c0129.msg:007f:0x00002BAE:00ec:12=The next race will be your last. I vow, we will leave you in utter shambles. The Black Panther Couriers are the fastest in Kyo!
uid016c0129.msg:0012:0x00002C36:0110:13=Are you all right?
uid016c0129.msg:000b:0x00002C49:011c:14=I think so.
uid016c0129.msg:0063:0x00002C55:0128:15=Our company has no room for the slow. I knew that, but I still never believed she'd really fire me.
uid016c0129.msg:003a:0x00002CB9:0134:16=Why is Hirakawa so obsessed with being the fastest in Kyo?
uid016c0129.msg:0052:0x00002CF4:0140:17=She wasn't always like this, really. Everything changed after her husband's death.
uid016c0129.msg:000c:0x00002D47:014c:18=Her husband?
uid016c0129.msg:0063:0x00002D54:0158:19=That's right. Hirakawa-san was the one who originally founded the Black Panther Couriers. Our boss.
uid016c0129.msg:0050:0x00002DB8:0164:20=He was a legend in our industry. His feet earned him the title "fastest in Kyo."
uid016c0129.msg:0004:0x00002E09:0170:21=Hmm.
uid016c0129.msg:0047:0x00002E0E:017c:22=The Panthers inherited that reputation from him, once we formed a team.
uid016c0129.msg:0068:0x00002E56:0188:23=We had good customer service too, back then. It wasn't long before we were the top couriers in the city.
uid016c0129.msg:0051:0x00002EBF:0194:24=And the chief... she always looked so happy. I wanted those days to last forever.
uid016c0129.msg:0035:0x00002F11:01a0:25=They couldn't, though. Not after the boss was killed.
uid016c0129.msg:000e:0x00002F47:01ac:26=He was killed?
uid016c0129.msg:0005:0x00002F56:01b8:27=Yeah.
uid016c0129.msg:0073:0x00002F5C:01c4:28=There was a rookie on the team. He got sent out on a delivery to this famous bloodthirsty samurai, but he was slow.
uid016c0129.msg:007a:0x00002FD0:01d0:29=When he arrived late, the samurai was furious. He attacked the kid with his sword, and the boss jumped in to defend him...
uid016c0129.msg:005c:0x0000304B:01dc:30=So, Hirakawa thinks that if the delivery hadn't been late, her husband would still be alive.
uid016c0129.msg:005f:0x000030A8:01e8:31=Ever since then, things have been different. She fired everyone who was too slow on their feet.
uid016c0129.msg:0051:0x00003108:01f4:32=All she cared about was preserving the image that the boss had. "Fastest in Kyo."
uid016c0129.msg:0060:0x0000315A:0200:33=Of course, once we started ignoring every other aspect of customer service, our reputation fell.
uid016c0129.msg:0064:0x000031BB:020c:34=So the chief came up with the idea of challenging other couriers and shaming them out of the market.
uid016c0129.msg:0033:0x00003220:0218:35=That's why you all started racing your competitors?
uid016c0129.msg:0079:0x00003254:0224:36=Understand, the Black Panther Couriers are the one memento she has of the boss. She'll do anything to protect his legacy.
uid016c0129.msg:0029:0x000032D5:023c:37=Saito-san, I have to ask you for a favor.
uid016c0129.msg:000b:0x000032FF:0248:38=What is it?
uid016c0129.msg:0017:0x0000330B:0254:39=Please, help our chief.
uid016c0129.msg:0028:0x0000332A:026c:40=I know that, deep down, she's suffering.
uid016c0129.msg:005f:0x00003353:0278:41=Being the fastest in Kyo is no longer a source of pride. It's become a nightmare, haunting her.
uid016c0129.msg:0045:0x000033B3:0284:42=So I need you, once and for all, to crush the Black Panther Couriers.
uid016c0129.msg:001d:0x000033F9:0290:43=This is really what you want?
uid016c0129.msg:007a:0x00003417:029c:44=This area's where I used to beg. The chief found me starving here one day, and she saved me. I'd never met anyone so kind.

uid016c0129.msg:0025:0x00003526:02cc:47=Inamoto's right. I want her back too.

uid016c0129.msg:000d:0x0000356E:02e4:49=I understand.
uid016c0129.msg:0053:0x0000357C:02f0:50=If you can beat Takeda, the Panthers will collapse. There's no one faster than him.

uid016c0134.msg:0055:0x0000548A:0348:49=But... what will I do? I've lost my husband. If I lose my company, I'll have nothing.

uid016e0031.msg:0089:0x0000239B:0130:15=Thank you... You're a good man. I assure you, the gods themselves must think as highly of you as I do. They will surely grant you Virtue.
uid016e0031.msg:0007:0x00002425:013c:16=Virtue?
uid016e0031.msg:007c:0x0000242D:0148:17=Oh yes. The locals here have known since the olden times that the gods will bestow praise and Virtue upon those who do good.
uid016e0031.msg:0097:0x000024AA:0154:18=You could cultivate all the Virtue you want by going around this town punishing the wicked. And by good deeds too, but that's less exciting, of course.
uid016e0031.msg:0060:0x00002542:0160:19=It is said those who cultivate the most Virtue will be handsomely rewarded in a variety of ways.

uid016e0031.msg:004c:0x0000288C:01cc:28=Right? That's how Virtue feels! Cultivate Virtue just like that, bit by bit.
uid016e0031.msg:0032:0x000028D9:01d8:29=Bit by bit? You make it sound like a slow process.
uid016e0031.msg:0063:0x0000290C:01e4:30=True, but there are ways to earn a lot of Virtue quickly. Namely, fulfilling the Diligence Records.

uid016e0031.msg:0019:0x00002B01:022c:36=Sure. I'll give it a try.
uid016e0031.msg:003f:0x00002B1B:0238:37=Marvelous. And once you've cultivated some Virtue, come see me.
uid016e0031.msg:008b:0x00002B5B:0244:38=I may not look it, but I'm a Shinto priest. I can channel any Virtue you have to the gods, and they'll give you divine blessings in return.

uid016e0031.msg:0076:0x00002C86:0280:42=Ah! So you've cultivated at least 50 Virtue. I'll channel that to the gods, and they'll grant you blessings in return.

uid016e00a9.msg:0034:0x0000819E:00cc:4=I apologize for the sudden visit. My name is Akechi.
uid016e00a9.msg:0045:0x000081D3:00d8:5=I was sent here to convey a message from the Great Warlord Okehazama.
uid016e00a9.msg:000b:0x00008219:00e4:6=Who's that?
uid016e00a9.msg:0074:0x00008225:00f0:7=I beg your pardon!? You've not heard of Lord Okehazama's exploits!? His mighty deeds? His ruthless cunning? Nothing?

uid016e00a9.msg:0051:0x000082B3:0108:9=This... cannot be...  But perhaps... Yes, perhaps this is a blessing in disguise.

uid016e00a9.msg:0061:0x00008309:0120:11=Nothing! Nothing... Just a foolish man muttering nonsense. I've actually come to request a favor.
uid016e00a9.msg:0008:0x0000836B:012c:12=Such as?
uid016e00a9.msg:0044:0x00008374:0138:13=Well, I would like you to... To prepare a sumptuous meal for milord.
uid016e00a9.msg:0034:0x000083B9:0144:14=Hold on, you want <i>me</i> to cook? For a warlord!?
uid016e00a9.msg:0090:0x000083EE:0150:15=Indeed. You see, milord has rather... particular tastes. He only dines on what he deems exquisite, and will travel far and wide in search of it.
uid016e00a9.msg:005a:0x0000847F:015c:16=Now, as the local rumors go, a delectable aroma is often found lingering about your abode.
uid016e00a9.msg:0064:0x000084DA:0168:17=Those rumors spread like wildfire, and that is how you, good sir, have attracted milord's attention.
uid016e00a9.msg:001b:0x0000853F:0174:18=So that's what brought you.
uid016e00a9.msg:006f:0x0000855B:0180:19=That's right. Now, if you're able to cook up something truly beyond compare, milord will reward you handsomely.
uid016e00a9.msg:0045:0x000085CB:018c:20=So, how about it? Will you lend your hearth and hands in his service?
uid016e00a9.msg:004f:0x00008611:0198:21=(I'm not a chef. There's no way my cooking could please some arrogant warlord.)
uid016e00a9.msg:002e:0x00008661:01a4:22=I'm sorry,  but I don't think that's possible.
uid016e00a9.msg:0015:0x00008690:01b0:23=I see... What a pity.
uid016e00a9.msg:0064:0x000086A6:01bc:24=Be that as it may, I come at the behest of a great and terrible man. Failure is not to be tolerated.
uid016e00a9.msg:007e:0x0000870B:01c8:25=Perhaps you have your reasons for refusing. But until you change your mind, I will await you at Hanako, an izakaya in Fushimi.
uid016e00a9.msg:0040:0x0000878A:01d4:26=Come fetch me when you decide to honor milord with your cooking.
uid016e00a9.msg:001e:0x000087D6:021c:27=Fine. What have I got to lose?
uid016e00a9.msg:004b:0x000087F5:0228:28=You'll do it!? Oh, you're wonderful! Milord will certainly be most pleased!
uid016e00a9.msg:0032:0x00008841:0234:29=I'll have a fellow messenger send for him at once.
uid016e00a9.msg:004f:0x00008875:024c:30=Uncle Hajime? Is something going on? I was thinking of heading out for a bit...
uid016e00a9.msg:002e:0x000088C5:0258:31=You go right ahead, Haruka. Be safe out there.
uid016e00a9.msg:001d:0x000088F4:0264:32=Will do! See you later, then!
uid016e00a9.msg:003f:0x00008913:027c:33=Well... Perhaps we should head inside? Much preparation awaits.
uid016e00a9.msg:0037:0x00008957:02b8:34=I see knives... Plenty of firewood... Hmm... What else?
uid016e00a9.msg:0017:0x0000898F:02c4:35=Ah. How could I forget?
uid016e00a9.msg:0036:0x000089A7:02d0:36=Today's principal ingredient: thoroughly grilled fish.
uid016e00a9.msg:0023:0x000089DE:02dc:37=I see you really did come prepared.
uid016e00a9.msg:0061:0x00008A02:02e8:38=Why wouldn't I? This meal may very well change the course of history! I hope you understand that!
uid016e00a9.msg:004b:0x00008A64:02f4:39=This warlord... Okehazama, was it? Does he really have that much influence?
uid016e00a9.msg:0062:0x00008AB0:0300:40=O-Of course he does! How ignorant can you be!? Have you any idea what kind of hot water we're in!?
uid016e00a9.msg:000d:0x00008B13:030c:41=Hot water...?
uid016e00a9.msg:000b:0x00008B21:0318:42=Oh. Well...
uid016e00a9.msg:001d:0x00008B2D:0324:43=...No point in hiding it now.
uid016e00a9.msg:007b:0x00008B4B:0330:44=Milord is a very strict man... The reason I came to your doorstep is because everyone who's cooked for milord has perished.
uid016e00a9.msg:000e:0x00008BC7:033c:45=Perished? How?
uid016e00a9.msg:004f:0x00008BD6:0348:46=Well, you see, those who offend the great Okehazama with an ill-tasting dish...
uid016e00a9.msg:001d:0x00008C26:0354:47=...Must pay with their lives!
uid016e00a9.msg:0031:0x00008C44:0360:48=What!? Your lord would really murder over a meal?
uid016e00a9.msg:0095:0x00008C76:036c:49=I'm afraid so. I told you, he's strict, with a white-hot temper to boot... Such is why no one makes him food anymore. Everyone is much too terrified.
uid016e00a9.msg:0019:0x00008D0C:0378:50=Why am I not surprised...
uid016e00a9.msg:0077:0x00008D26:0384:51=At any rate, it goes against my judgment to serve a man like that, let alone cook for him. I'm going to have to refuse.
uid016e00a9.msg:0063:0x00008D9E:0390:52=P-Please! Please don't do that! If you refuse, all of his retainers will be killed! Including me...
uid016e00a9.msg:004f:0x00008E02:039c:53=I beg of you! Think of all the lives you could save by preparing a simple fish!
uid016e00a9.msg:0014:0x00008E52:03a8:54=I understand, but...
uid016e00a9.msg:0043:0x00008E69:03cc:55=Oh! Milord has arrived! This is it, Sir Saito! I'm counting on you!
uid016e00a9.msg:001b:0x00008EAF:03f0:56=...Treacherous guy you are.
uid016e00a9.msg:0024:0x00008ED1:0444:57=(So, here's our infamous warlord...)
uid016e00a9.msg:0026:0x00008EF6:0450:58=Milord, this is the chef... Sir Saito.
uid016e00a9.msg:0008:0x00008F1D:045c:59=...Hmph.
uid016e00a9.msg:0044:0x00008F27:0474:60=Saito. I'm told your cooking has some merit, at least for a bumpkin.
uid016e00a9.msg:001b:0x00008F6D:048c:61=...Think it can satisfy me?
uid016e00a9.msg:000c:0x00008F90:04a4:62=I can't say.
uid016e00a9.msg:0012:0x00008F9D:04b0:63=Wha... Sir Saito!?
uid016e00a9.msg:003c:0x00008FB0:04bc:64=Haughty bastard! Do you even know who you're disrespecting!?
uid016e00a9.msg:0031:0x00008FED:04c8:65=All I can do is cook... and let you be the judge.
uid016e00a9.msg:0019:0x00009026:04e0:66=Curious fellow, this one.
uid016e00a9.msg:0013:0x00009040:04ec:67=Very well. Proceed.
uid016e00a9.msg:0054:0x00009054:04f8:68=(Huh. This could very well be my last meal... Sounds like an interesting challenge.)
uid016e00a9.msg:002e:0x000090A9:0504:69=Time to make like a civilized man... and cook!
uid016e00a9.msg:0016:0x000090DA:0528:70=Thank you for waiting.
uid016e00a9.msg:0020:0x000090F1:0534:71=I call this...  Well, it's fish.
uid016e00a9.msg:0009:0x00009112:0540:72=Indeed...
uid016e00a9.msg:0011:0x0000911C:054c:73=Go ahead. Try it.
uid016e00a9.msg:000a:0x0000914E:05b8:74=Delicious.
uid016e00a9.msg:000b:0x00009159:05c4:75=M-Milord...
uid016e00a9.msg:0015:0x00009165:05d0:76=He actually likes it!
uid016e00a9.msg:0088:0x0000917B:05dc:77=This simple, honest flavor... It embodies every quality of what a food should taste like. I want this every day for the rest of my life.
uid016e00a9.msg:0029:0x00009204:05e8:78=How about it, Saito? Be my personal chef.
uid016e00a9.msg:0041:0x0000922E:05f4:79=No thank you. I'm not keen on getting killed over one wrong meal.
uid016e00a9.msg:0007:0x00009270:0600:80=Killed?
uid016e00a9.msg:0085:0x00009278:060c:81=You heard me. It's wrong to take a man's life over something as petty as taste. I have no intention of working for someone like that.
uid016e00a9.msg:0021:0x000092FE:0618:82=Ah... I see what's going on here.
uid016e00a9.msg:000a:0x00009320:0624:83=...Akechi.
uid016e00a9.msg:0006:0x0000932B:0630:84=Y-Yes?
uid016e00a9.msg:0032:0x00009332:063c:85=Have you been spinning your spurious tales again!?
uid016e00a9.msg:002b:0x00009365:0648:86=Eeeeeek! I have indeed, milord! Forgive me!
uid016e00a9.msg:0010:0x00009391:0654:87=Wait, what tale?
uid016e00a9.msg:0044:0x000093A5:0684:88=I see. So Akechi-san made the whole killing off your chefs thing up.
uid016e00a9.msg:0041:0x000093EA:0690:89=A-All I wanted was to ensure a proper dish reached milord's lips.
uid016e00a9.msg:0050:0x0000942C:069c:90=I thought if I told you that, you'd be determined to put your best efforts in...
uid016e00a9.msg:007a:0x0000947D:06a8:91=Is that so? Well, I understand your intention, but that's taking it way too far. Think about all the pressure I was under.
uid016e00a9.msg:0074:0x000094F8:06b4:92=Right, and thanks to your spineless meddling, my reputation's been sullied. Tell me, how am I supposed to fix that!?
uid016e00a9.msg:007c:0x0000956D:06c0:93=I-I don't have an answer, milord. But consider this... Were you not able to enjoy a delicious meal because of one small lie?
uid016e00a9.msg:000d:0x000095EA:06cc:94=...I suppose.
uid016e00a9.msg:002e:0x000095F8:06d8:95=Anyway, Saito. Thanks for the satisfying meal.
uid016e00a9.msg:0091:0x00009627:06e4:96=It really is a shame I can't have a chef like you... But if you have a change of heart, you come right to me. You shall receive a lavish welcome.
uid016e00a9.msg:0060:0x000096B9:06f0:97=Heh. Maybe I'll hold the knife when I retire from the sword. Something to think about, at least.
uid016e00a9.msg:002a:0x0000971A:06fc:98=Then I eagerly await your favorable reply.
uid016e00a9.msg:0013:0x00009745:0708:99=With that, I'm off.
uid016e00a9.msg:0009:0x00009759:0714:100=Farewell.
uid016e00a9.msg:005d:0x00009764:072c:101=I apologize for bringing such... sudden discord into your home. Here is your promised reward.
uid016e00a9.msg:0030:0x000097C2:0738:102=Obtained <Color:8>Dragon Whisker<Color:Default>.
uid016e00a9.msg:0040:0x000097F4:0750:103=You're really something, though... I didn't think you'd survive.
uid016e00a9.msg:002d:0x00009835:075c:104=Heh. You don't need to lie anymore, remember?
uid016e00a9.msg:0019:0x00009863:0768:105=Huh? Oh... right. Lies...
uid016e00a9.msg:008f:0x0000987D:0774:106=Hey, dimwit! How long do you intend to keep me waiting!? Hurry it up, or I'll have your home razed to the ground with everyone you love inside!
uid016e00a9.msg:0032:0x0000990D:0780:107=No! No need for that, milord, I'll be right there!
uid016e00a9.msg:005c:0x00009941:0798:108=(Killing chefs who serve bad food... What a stupid story. Guess I was a fool to believe it.)
uid016e00a9.msg:0063:0x0000999E:07a4:109=(Well, at least the man seemed satisfied, plus I got a reward. I'd say that worked out in the end.)
uid016e00a9.msg:001e:0x00009A07:07ec:110=What a bold man that chef was!

uid016e00a9.msg:000e:0x00009AE9:0840:116=S-Sir Saito...
uid016e00a9.msg:006b:0x00009AF8:084c:117=I didn't mean to offend you. But in all honesty, I'm not a real chef. The only cutlery I handle are swords.
uid016e00a9.msg:0005:0x00009B64:0858:118=What?
uid016e00a9.msg:0047:0x00009B6A:0864:119=On that note, I won't meet my end here. I still have much to fight for.
uid016e00a9.msg:000e:0x00009BB2:0870:120=Meet your end?
uid016e00a9.msg:006c:0x00009BC1:087c:121=I know you kill your own chefs if they displease you. That's cruel, and I refuse to become your next victim.

uid016e00a9.msg:0006:0x00009C5B:08a0:124=Y-Yes?

uid016e00a9.msg:002b:0x00009C95:08b8:126=Eeeeeek! I have indeed, milord! Forgive me!
uid016e00a9.msg:0010:0x00009CC1:08c4:127=Wait, what tale?
uid016e00a9.msg:0044:0x00009CD5:08f4:128=I see. So Akechi-san made the whole killing off your chefs thing up.
uid016e00a9.msg:0041:0x00009D1A:0900:129=A-All I wanted was to ensure a proper dish reached milord's lips.
uid016e00a9.msg:0050:0x00009D5C:090c:130=I thought if I told you that, you'd be determined to put your best efforts in...
uid016e00a9.msg:006a:0x00009DAD:0918:131=Is that so? Well, you sure got the opposite of what you intended. Think about how nervous you make people.
uid016e00a9.msg:0074:0x00009E18:0924:132=Right, and thanks to your spineless meddling, my reputation's been sullied. Tell me, how am I supposed to fix that!?
uid016e00a9.msg:0023:0x00009E8D:0930:133=I-I don't have an answer, milord...
uid016e00a9.msg:0051:0x00009EB1:093c:134=Well... I suppose you meant him no harm. Please forgive the antics of this moron.
uid016e00a9.msg:0009:0x00009F03:0948:135=Let's go.
uid016e00a9.msg:001e:0x00009F0D:0954:136=Oh, and sorry for the trouble.
uid016e00a9.msg:00a3:0x00009F2D:096c:137=I apologize for bringing such... sudden discord into your home. Unfortunately, I can't reward lackluster cooking, but I can at least part with this as consolation.

uid016e00a9.msg:0019:0x0000A086:09a8:141=Huh? Oh... right. Lies...
uid016e00a9.msg:008f:0x0000A0A0:09b4:142=Hey, dimwit! How long do you intend to keep me waiting!? Hurry it up, or I'll have your home razed to the ground with everyone you love inside!
uid016e00a9.msg:0032:0x0000A130:09c0:143=No! No need for that, milord, I'll be right there!
uid016e00a9.msg:005c:0x0000A164:09d8:144=(Killing chefs who serve bad food... What a stupid story. Guess I was a fool to believe it.)
uid016e00a9.msg:0049:0x0000A1C1:09e4:145=(Well. Although my food was terrible, at least there were no casualties.)
uid016e00a9.msg:0024:0x0000A20F:0a20:146=...Are you not disappointed, milord?
uid016e00a9.msg:0074:0x0000A234:0a2c:147=...No. Not in the man's strength. One wrong step and my legacy would have ended then and there. That much was clear.
uid016e00a9.msg:0034:0x0000A2AA:0a44:148=Ahahaha... I shall not be deceived by such humility.
uid016e00a9.msg:0032:0x0000A2DF:0a50:149=Hah. You know, you're quite the deceiver yourself.
uid016e00b7.msg:0046:0x00002278:0048:1=Mmm... What to do? A strong warrior... I must find a strong warrior...
uid016e00b7.msg:0017:0x000022C1:006c:2=Oh? Um, excuse me, sir!
uid016e00b7.msg:0007:0x000022D9:0078:3=Hm? Me?
uid016e00b7.msg:0054:0x000022E1:0084:4=Indeed! Forgive me for this inquiry, but... by any chance, are you a strong warrior?
uid016e00b7.msg:0011:0x00002336:0090:5=A strong warrior?
uid016e00b7.msg:0086:0x00002348:009c:6=Hm. That's a difficult thing to judge. In my experience, true strength could have nothing to do with fighting ability... Then again...
uid016e00b7.msg:005e:0x000023CF:00a8:7=Um, sir. I'm afraid we must be hasty. May I assume you know how to use that sword on your hip?
uid016e00b7.msg:001d:0x0000242E:00b4:8=Huh? Oh. Yeah, in my own way.
uid016e00b7.msg:0044:0x0000244C:00c0:9=That will do! You see, I am a servant of the noble Kuramitsu family.
uid016e00b7.msg:0025:0x00002491:00cc:10=We are in urgent need of a bodyguard.
uid016e00b7.msg:000c:0x000024B7:00d8:11=A bodyguard?
uid016e00b7.msg:003f:0x000024C4:00e4:12=Yes. Within this palanquin is our scion, Kuramitsu Sayoko-sama.
uid016e00b7.msg:0043:0x00002505:00fc:13=Regretfully, she has drawn the unwanted attention of a certain man.
uid016e00b7.msg:000a:0x00002549:0108:14=Who is he?
uid016e00b7.msg:007c:0x00002554:0114:15=His name is Hayakaze. A member of a samurai household, he's fallen in love with our Sayoko-sama and hounds her to marry him.
uid016e00b7.msg:0066:0x000025D1:0120:16=No matter how often she refuses his hand, he persists. It's beginning to affect her very constitution.
uid016e00b7.msg:0048:0x00002638:012c:17=We're to escort Sayoko-sama to a secret refuge, beyond Hayakaze's reach.
uid016e00b7.msg:0024:0x00002681:0138:18=Hm. That seems like a good decision.
uid016e00b7.msg:004e:0x000026A6:0144:19=Unfortunately, Hayakaze was somehow made aware of our intentions to leave Kyo.
uid016e00b7.msg:004c:0x000026F5:0150:20=Knowing this could be his final chance at winning her, he sent us a missive.
uid016e00b7.msg:004b:0x00002742:015c:21="Sayoko, you are mine eternally, and I will have you in Rakugai," it reads.
uid016e00b7.msg:005e:0x0000278E:0168:22=Knowing his usual tactics, we can expect some number of ambushes from his men along our route.
uid016e00b7.msg:0006:0x000027ED:0174:23=I see.
uid016e00b7.msg:0030:0x000027F7:01a4:24=Well done! We've made it safely through Rakugai.
uid016e00b7.msg:0008:0x00002828:01b0:25=Somehow.
uid016e00b7.msg:0042:0x00002831:01bc:26=I must say, your swordsmanship was truly something to behold, sir.
uid016e00b7.msg:0045:0x00002874:01c8:27=However, Hayakaze himself has yet to appear. We must remain cautious.
uid016e00b7.msg:0007:0x000028BA:01d4:28=Sayoko!
uid016e00b7.msg:0013:0x000028C4:01f8:29=It's him! Hayakaze!
uid016e00b7.msg:0055:0x000028D8:0204:30=Sayoko, my beloved... To think you would be so coy as to plan this elaborate charade.
uid016e00b7.msg:003f:0x0000292E:0210:31=If you wish me to steal you away this fervently, then so be it!
uid016e00b7.msg:0024:0x0000296E:021c:32=We—We wish naught of y-you at all!
uid016e00b7.msg:0039:0x00002993:0228:33=(Sounds like she's so frightened she can barely speak...)
uid016e00b7.msg:0066:0x000029CD:0234:34=Hm? I take it you're the one who routed my men. I suffer none to live that would deny me my betrothed.
uid016e00b7.msg:0056:0x00002A34:0240:35=Have at you! You may enjoy the grandeur of our matrimony from the finest seat in hell!
uid016e00b7.msg:0049:0x00002A8C:0258:36=How could this be? Sayoko... I've failed you. I am unfit for your love...
uid016e00b7.msg:002d:0x00002AD6:0264:37=You've done it! Sayoko-sama will be safe now.
uid016e00b7.msg:002d:0x00002B04:0270:38=Your reward, sir. It's the least you deserve.
uid016e00b7.msg:002e:0x00002B32:027c:39=Obtained <Color:8>Crimson Bead<Color:Default>.

uid016e00b7.msg:001c:0x00002B68:02a0:41=Ah, Sayoko-sama. What is it?
uid016e00b7.msg:0038:0x00002B85:02ac:42=We would like to offer our thanks to Saito-sama as well.
uid016e00b7.msg:0070:0x00002BBE:02b8:43=Forgive me, Sayoko-sama, but I dare not let you step outside just yet. Hayakaze must first be long out of sight.
uid016e00b7.msg:0036:0x00002C2F:02c4:44=It's all right. Your thanks from there is good enough.
uid016e00b7.msg:0032:0x00002C66:02d0:45=As you wish, Saito-sama. We bid you fond farewell.
uid016e00b7.msg:0042:0x00002C9B:02f4:46=(Hm. I never did see her face. She must've really been something.)

uid016e00cf.msg:0022:0x00006020:0494:71=Huh!? Okita Soji and Saito Hajime?
uid016e00cf.msg:0051:0x00006043:04a0:72=We don't stand a chance here. Those two alone could wipe us out. Boys, fall back!
uid016e00cf.msg:0032:0x00006096:04b8:73=Hey, what the fuck!? I wanted to get my sword wet!
uid016e00cf.msg:0021:0x000060D0:04d0:74=Buncha limpdicks. I'm goin' home.
uid016e00cf.msg:0023:0x000060F3:04e8:75=Hey, uh... Thank you for saving me!
uid016e00cf.msg:0043:0x00006117:04f4:76=Don't mention it. Places like this are crawling with men like them.
uid016e00cf.msg:0038:0x0000615B:0500:77=But if you insist on gambling, then best of luck to you.
uid016e00cf.msg:0017:0x00006195:0518:78=Wow... They're so cool!
uid016e00d0.msg:0036:0x000025C8:0038:1=Ah, Saito-san! Thanks for coming out. Here, follow me.
uid016e00d0.msg:0033:0x00002605:008c:2=Awfully deserted part of town, don't you think? Hm?
uid016e00d0.msg:0015:0x00002639:0098:3=There you are, Saito.
uid016e00d0.msg:0066:0x0000264F:00a4:4=Still up to no good? I thought you might've learned your lesson... Guess I'll have to teach you again.
uid016e00d0.msg:0031:0x000026B6:00b0:5=Heheheh. You think you're the one in charge here?
uid016e00d0.msg:0005:0x000026E8:00bc:6=What?
uid016e00d0.msg:009a:0x000026F0:00e0:7=You walked right into our trap, Saito-san. We're gonna pay you back for the way you and Okita embarrassed us before. Bet you didn't think you'd die today.
uid016e00d0.msg:0010:0x0000278B:00ec:8=Don't tell me...
uid016e00d0.msg:004f:0x0000279C:00f8:9=Hehehe. Hey, we're good, right? I did my part, so you better have my cut ready!
uid016e00d0.msg:007d:0x000027EC:0104:10=Yeah, you'll get your cut... out of whatever Saito has on him! We'll go through his pockets after we stab the shit outta him!
uid016e00d0.msg:0029:0x0000286A:0110:11=So... you guys were in cahoots all along.
uid016e00d0.msg:001e:0x00002895:0128:12=Hold on... Is that Saito-san!?
uid016e00d0.msg:0053:0x000028B4:0134:13=I don't like the looks of this. What about Okita-san? He's definitely not around...
uid016e00d0.msg:007a:0x00002908:0140:14=You may be the Third Division captain, but you don't got any backup this time. Think you stand a chance against all of us?
uid016e00d0.msg:0006:0x00002983:014c:15=Tch...
uid016e00d0.msg:001e:0x0000298A:0158:16=Crap! I've gotta do something!
uid016e00d0.msg:002a:0x000029A9:0164:17=I'm gonna enjoy this so, so much. Get him!

uid016e00d0.msg:0039:0x000029F2:0194:19=Heh. We didn't train in the art of the sword for nothing.
uid016e00d0.msg:007c:0x00002A2C:01a0:20=You Shinsengumi think you're hot shit!? You're nothing but a bunch of countryside trash! And your cocky ass is no different!
uid016e00d0.msg:004c:0x00002AA9:01ac:21=Lookit you, Hajime-chan, hoggin' all the fun... Save some for little ol' me!
uid016e00d0.msg:0013:0x00002AF6:01b8:22=Okita, is that you?
uid016e00d0.msg:0018:0x00002B0A:01c4:23=What!? Ah man... Okita!?
uid016e00d0.msg:0033:0x00002B23:01d0:24=I dare ya. Slander the Shinsengumi one more time...
uid016e00d0.msg:0023:0x00002B57:01dc:25=Do it if ya got the fuckin' guuuts!
uid016e00d0.msg:0007:0x00002B7B:01e8:26=Aieeee!
uid016e00d0.msg:008b:0x00002B83:01f4:27=You bumwipes got some balls pissin' off the cream of the Shinsengumi crop. Real impressive. Let's see if you can back up that big boy talk!
uid016e00d0.msg:004f:0x00002C0F:0200:28=Hey, if we fight Okita in our current condition, we'll never make it out alive!
uid016e00d0.msg:0036:0x00002C5F:020c:29=This was all a big mistake! You'll never see us again!
uid016e00d0.msg:0008:0x00002C96:0218:30=Okita...
uid016e00d0.msg:0008:0x00002C9F:0224:31=Wh-What?
uid016e00d0.msg:0013:0x00002CA8:0230:32=Phew. You saved me.
uid016e00d0.msg:004a:0x00002CBC:023c:33=Oh, uh, ain't nothin' to it, Hajime-chan. So yeah, I'll just see ya later!
uid016e00d0.msg:0021:0x00002D09:0260:34=Wait, Okita, where are you going?
uid016e00d0.msg:0017:0x00002D2D:0284:35=Whew... That was close.
uid016e00d1.msg:001a:0x000007D1:0034:1=Hajime-chan, ya dirty dog.
uid016e00d1.msg:001c:0x000007EC:0040:2=What's this all of a sudden?
uid016e00d1.msg:0037:0x00000809:004c:3=I heard about yer kerfuffle with the gamblin' grifters.
uid016e00d1.msg:0040:0x00000841:0058:4=And ya went to town on 'em! Without lettin' me in on the action!
uid016e00d1.msg:0034:0x00000882:0064:5=What in the world? But you were right there with me.
uid016e00d1.msg:005a:0x000008B7:0070:6=Huh? What kinda gibberish ya spoutin'? Ya went and beat those guys all to hell without me.
uid016e00d1.msg:0045:0x00000912:007c:7=How hard is it to let me know where the fun's happenin'? Eh, fuck it.
uid016e00d1.msg:0026:0x00000959:0094:8=Hmm... He sure is a mystery sometimes.
uid016e0131.msg:0012:0x00001B54:0028:1=Argh, this stinks!
uid016e0131.msg:0029:0x00001B67:0034:2=Why does everybody else get to have fun!?
uid016e0131.msg:001b:0x00001B91:0040:3=What about... What about...
uid016e0131.msg:0014:0x00001BAD:004c:4=What about meeeeee!?
uid016e0131.msg:0013:0x00001BCA:0070:5=Aah! Don't kill me!
uid016e0131.msg:0021:0x00001BDE:007c:6=What makes you think I'd do that?
uid016e0131.msg:0016:0x00001C00:0088:7=Oh, uh, I'm s-sorry...
uid016e0131.msg:0031:0x00001C17:0094:8=What was all that "what about me" stuff just now?
uid016e0131.msg:0004:0x00001C49:00a0:9=Huh?
uid016e0131.msg:004b:0x00001C4E:00ac:10=You were talking to yourself. Complaining about something, it sounded like.
uid016e0131.msg:0009:0x00001C9A:00b8:11=Oh, uh...
uid016e0131.msg:0043:0x00001CA4:00c4:12=No worries if you don't want to talk about it. Sorry to bother you.
uid016e0131.msg:0038:0x00001CE9:00dc:13=It's, uh... I wanna... I wanna play with the others too!
uid016e0131.msg:008f:0x00001D2F:013c:14=And my parents are really strict and stuff! I never get the toys all the other kids get! No pinwheels or bubble makers! Not even spinning tops!
uid016e0131.msg:0060:0x00001DBF:0148:15=If you wanna make it in this town, it's really important to have the same toys as everyone else!
uid016e0131.msg:0039:0x00001E20:0154:16=But my mom and dad just don't understand... It's so dumb!
uid016e0131.msg:0029:0x00001E5A:0160:17=I see. I guess kids have it pretty rough.
uid016e0131.msg:0072:0x00001E84:016c:18=We do! Like even today! Everyone was playing with their spinning tops, and I was the only kid who didn't have one!
uid016e0131.msg:002f:0x00001EF7:0178:19=So that's why you were off sulking by yourself.
uid016e0131.msg:0007:0x00001F27:0184:20=Yeah...
uid016e0131.msg:0080:0x00001F2F:0190:21=To be honest, I don't know much about being a kid these days, but is having the same toy as everyone else really that important?
uid016e0131.msg:006a:0x00001FB0:019c:22=Of course it is... I mean, think about it, if you don't have a spinning top, you can't exactly play along!
uid016e0131.msg:001c:0x0000201B:01a8:23=I don't know if that's true.
uid016e0131.msg:0015:0x00002038:01b4:24=Huh? Of course it is!
uid016e0131.msg:009c:0x0000204E:01c0:25=Well, even if you don't have a spinning top, I'm sure you can still enjoy spending time with your friends. You can be a judge or cheer them on or something.
uid016e0131.msg:0006:0x000020EB:01cc:26=Hmm...
uid016e0131.msg:004a:0x000020F2:01d8:27=And, even then, maybe you could borrow one from them? Have you tried that?
uid016e0131.msg:003b:0x0000213D:01e4:28=No... I don't have anything for them to borrow in return...
uid016e0131.msg:0052:0x00002179:01f0:29=There's an inherent lack of equivalent exchange! What kind of friendship is that!?
uid016e0131.msg:002f:0x000021CC:01fc:30=Those are some pretty big words you're using...
uid016e0131.msg:004d:0x000021FC:0208:31=If I had something to offer them first, I could probably borrow their toys...
uid016e0131.msg:0014:0x0000224A:0214:32=Hey, I know, mister!
uid016e0131.msg:001c:0x0000225F:0220:33=You know, I've got a name...
uid016e0131.msg:0041:0x0000227C:022c:34=Mister, is there anything you have right now that you don't want?
uid016e0131.msg:003e:0x000022BE:0238:35=Something I don't want...? You'd really be okay with anything?
uid016e0131.msg:0017:0x000022FD:0244:36=Yeah! Whatever you got!
uid016e0131.msg:0053:0x00002315:0250:37=Maybe you didn't know, mister, but us kids can turn just about anything into a toy.
uid016e0131.msg:0015:0x00002369:025c:38=Heh. All right, then.
uid016e016d.msg:0061:0x00001B89:0054:1=Oh wow, thank you so much. That guy was a terrible thief, with a long list of crimes to his name.
uid016e016d.msg:0012:0x00001BEB:0060:2=You two all right?
uid016e016d.msg:000f:0x00001BFE:006c:3=I sure am. See?
uid016e016d.msg:0021:0x00001C0E:0078:4=Me too, I was barely hurt at all.
uid016e016d.msg:0014:0x00001C30:0084:5=That's good to hear.
uid016e016d.msg:006a:0x00001C45:0090:6=I'm amazed you keep lending us your assistance like you do for Haruka-chan. You're a noble man, Saito-san.
uid016e016d.msg:0031:0x00001CB0:009c:7=Nah. I just did what obviously needed to be done.
uid016e016d.msg:0055:0x00001CE2:00a8:8=I can't help feeling like I should be the one helping you out. I'm the priest here...
uid016e016d.msg:000c:0x00001D38:00b4:9=Hey, I know!
uid016e016d.msg:0005:0x00001D45:00c0:10=What?
uid016e016d.msg:0036:0x00001D4B:00cc:11=I'll do what I can for you... with my spiritual power!
uid016e016d.msg:000d:0x00001D90:00f0:12=Like minds...
uid016e016d.msg:0011:0x00001D9E:00fc:13=...bring about...
uid016e016d.msg:0012:0x00001DB0:0108:14=...abundant faith!
uid016e016d.msg:0036:0x00001DCE:0150:15=...Whoa! I do feel like something changed inside me...
uid016e016d.msg:004b:0x00001E05:015c:16=Hehehe. I did something special, something only a priest could possibly do.
uid016e016d.msg:0065:0x00001E51:0168:17=You're a great person, Saito-san. And much like me, you've got certain unique skills nobody else has.
uid016e016d.msg:0087:0x00001EB7:0174:18=So please, keep making the most of them. I believe you can make the world a better place, and I know the gods themselves agree with me.
uid016e016d.msg:0017:0x00001F3F:0180:19=Heh. All right, priest.
uid016e016d.msg:0078:0x00001F57:018c:20=Hehe. Maybe that sounded a bit serious coming from me, but come on, Saito-san, we need to keep pursuing our noble paths!
uid016e016d.msg:0009:0x00001FD7:01ec:21=(Hey...!)
uid016e016d.msg:0028:0x00001FE2:0204:22=(Why was he in such a hurry? Madness...)
uid016e016d.msg:0006:0x0000200C:021c:23=Oww...
uid016e016d.msg:001c:0x00002013:0228:24=What's wrong? You all right?
uid016e016d.msg:0063:0x00002030:0234:25=Ugh... A man came out of nowhere and punched me... He took our money <i>and</i> the temple money...
uid016e016d.msg:0033:0x00002094:0240:26=A man? Wait, was it the guy who passed me just now?
uid016e016d.msg:0027:0x000020C8:024c:27=Ugh... We need to catch him right away!
uid016e016d.msg:0047:0x000020F0:0258:28=Leave it to me. I'll hunt him down for you. You two stay here and rest.
uid016e016d.msg:003f:0x00002139:0270:29=Oh, Saito-san, I'm so grateful... What would we do without you?
uid016e01ab.msg:005c:0x0000322F:009c:1=Hey there, Saito-san. You're looking stern as ever. How's it been with Haruka-chan recently?
uid016e01ab.msg:001d:0x0000328E:00c0:2=Oh, we've been getting along.
uid016e01ab.msg:002f:0x000032AD:00d8:3=That's great to hear. Always good to get along.
uid016e01ab.msg:005d:0x000032DD:00e4:4=But you know... Haruka's getting to be that age. Where you start hoping she finds a nice guy.
uid016e01ab.msg:000d:0x0000333B:00f0:5=...I suppose.
uid016e01ab.msg:006a:0x00003349:00fc:6=But at the same time, if Haruka-chan goes off and gets married, won't you get lonely, Saito-san? Hahaha...
uid016e01ab.msg:0021:0x000033B4:0108:7=What are you getting at, exactly?
uid016e01ab.msg:0005:0x000033DE:012c:8=Okay!
uid016e01ab.msg:002f:0x000033E5:0144:9=Oh, excuse me, Saito-san. Do you have a moment?
uid016e01ab.msg:000b:0x00003415:0150:10=What is it?
uid016e01ab.msg:0029:0x00003421:015c:11=I couldn't possibly talk about it here...
uid016e01ab.msg:0037:0x0000344B:0168:12=What? What is it? Does it have something to do with me?
uid016e01ab.msg:0040:0x00003483:0174:13=This has absolutely nothing to do with you. Only with Saito-san.
uid016e01ab.msg:0014:0x000034CB:018c:14=Uh, all right, then.
uid016e01ab.msg:0014:0x000034E6:01e0:15=So. What's going on?
uid016e01ab.msg:004d:0x000034FB:01ec:16=Well, I'm not sure if I should be asking you for this out of the blue, but...
uid016e01ab.msg:0041:0x00003549:01f8:17=I just want to know! What are your feelings toward Haruka-san...?
uid016e01ab.msg:0014:0x0000358B:0204:18=My feelings? Well...
uid016e01ab.msg:001d:0x000035A0:0210:19=Very simply... I love Haruka.
uid016e01ab.msg:0016:0x000035BE:021c:20=I-I suspected as much.
uid016e01ab.msg:0044:0x000035D5:0228:21=Yes, Haruka's as important as family to me. Why wouldn't I love her?
uid016e01ab.msg:000d:0x0000361A:0234:22=Wait, family?
uid016e01ab.msg:0020:0x00003628:0240:23=Yeah, something wrong with that?
uid016e01ab.msg:002f:0x00003649:024c:24=Oh, not at all! Hehe... Nothing's wrong at all!
uid016e01ab.msg:002c:0x00003679:0258:25=So... Was that all you wanted to talk about?
uid016e01ab.msg:001d:0x000036A6:0264:26=Hm? Oh, yes! That's alllll...
uid016e01ab.msg:0017:0x000036CC:027c:27=I think she's adorable!
uid016e01ab.msg:0016:0x000036E4:0288:28=Wait, a... "adorable"?
uid016e01ab.msg:0050:0x000036FB:0294:29=Sure, she's like a daughter to me. Why wouldn't I think my daughter is adorable?
uid016e01ab.msg:0022:0x0000374C:02a0:30=Huh? So you see her as a daughter?
uid016e01ab.msg:0020:0x0000376F:02ac:31=Sure. Something wrong with that?
uid016e01ab.msg:002a:0x00003790:02b8:32=Oh, not at all! Hehe... Nothiiiing at all!
uid016e01ab.msg:002a:0x000037BB:02c4:33=So? Was that all you wanted to talk about?
uid016e01ab.msg:0019:0x000037E6:02d0:34=Huh? Oh, yes! That's all!
uid016e01ab.msg:001c:0x00003808:02e8:35=I think of Haruka as family.
uid016e01ab.msg:000d:0x00003825:02f4:36=What? Family?
uid016e01ab.msg:0025:0x00003833:0300:37=Of course. Something wrong with that?
uid016e01ab.msg:0028:0x00003859:030c:38=Oh, not at all! Hehe... Nothing's wrong!

uid016e01be.msg:0037:0x00001918:00dc:12=What? Wrong? No, I wouldn't say there's anything wrong.

uid016e01be.msg:0090:0x00001CD9:0184:26=And I'll reward you well, of course! Should you bring me each of the swords I wish to see, you can take one of my treasured blades for yourself!
uid016e01be.msg:0087:0x00001D6A:0190:27=Wow, just to look at some other swords? Fine then. Not a bad deal at all. I'll show you your Ebony Sword if I ever get my hands on one.
uid016e01be.msg:0033:0x00001DF2:019c:28=Truly!? Heehee, I'm so excited I can't help myself!

uid016e01c1.msg:008b:0x0000158C:0058:4=I'm sorry I didn't thank you properly for that. I'd just been told that my mother had passed out, so I was in the middle of rushing home...
uid016e01c1.msg:0039:0x00001618:0064:5=Oh, pay no worry to that! How is your mother, by the way?
uid016e01c1.msg:005f:0x00001652:0070:6=Well, I fetched the doctor right away and thanks to his efforts, she's resting comfortably now.
uid016e01c1.msg:001b:0x000016B2:007c:7=Oh! Well, that's good news.
uid016e01c1.msg:0068:0x000016CE:0088:8=Yes, but if I had been any slower bringing the doctor to my house, he says it would've been a tragedy...
uid016e01c1.msg:002c:0x00001737:0094:9=So, if you hadn't stepped in when you did...
uid016e01c1.msg:0047:0x00001764:00a0:10=You truly saved my mother's life... and I'll be ever grateful for that.

uid016e01c1.msg:0069:0x000017B8:00b8:12=Yes—while you may not have gotten the upper hand in that fight, I think you were... <i>very</i> heroic.

uid016e01c1.msg:000d:0x00001889:00f4:15=Oh, it's you.
uid016e01c1.msg:0046:0x00001897:0100:16=You had said it was pointless for you to try helping people in need...

uid016e01c1.msg:0011:0x00001A93:016c:25=Heh, makes sense.
uid016e01c1.msg:0066:0x00001AA5:0178:26=I can't imagine what it's like to step in and help someone only to get my ass handed to me every time.

uid016f0022.msg:005f:0x00004D74:0138:19=I came to Japan for work, but in truth, I've always felt a personal attraction to your country.
uid016f0022.msg:0071:0x00004DD4:0144:20=Now that I'm here, I can't believe my eyes. It's greater than I'd imagined! Your people are kind and captivating!
uid016f0022.msg:0047:0x00004E46:0150:21=And so, sometimes I brush off work and come here to chat with everyone.
uid016f0022.msg:001e:0x00004E8E:015c:22=Hey, Sato-san! Up for a drink?
uid016f0022.msg:0014:0x00004EAD:0168:23=Yes, yes! On my way.
uid016f0022.msg:0043:0x00004EC2:0174:24=Sorry! <i>Gomen</i>, right? Have to catch up with my other friends.
uid016f0022.msg:0011:0x00004F06:0180:25=Sure. No problem.
uid016f0022.msg:0029:0x00004F19:0198:26=Hey, first time you're out with Sato-san?
uid016f0022.msg:0032:0x00004F43:01a4:27=Mm. I only just met him. He seems popular, though.
uid016f0022.msg:005d:0x00004F76:01b0:28=You said it! By now, he's a local fixture. He's polite and charming and generous with drinks.
uid016f0022.msg:0060:0x00004FD4:01bc:29=And he's a great ear when you've got something on your mind. Always shows an interest in people.
uid016f0022.msg:002d:0x00005035:01c8:30=So, people 'round here have taken to the guy.
uid016f0022.msg:000a:0x00005063:01d4:31=Hm. I see.
uid016f0022.msg:0048:0x0000506E:01e0:32=(Surprising... Most people in Kyo aren't comfortable around foreigners.)
uid016f0022.msg:0032:0x000050B7:01ec:33=(But this one's become a regular at an izakaya...)
uid016f0022.msg:0042:0x000050EB:0204:34=Ha! Oh, Saito-san. Why didn't you tell me you finished your drink?
uid016f0022.msg:0027:0x0000512E:0210:35=Barkeep! Another one over here, please!
uid016f0022.msg:0005:0x00005156:021c:36=Um...
uid016f0022.msg:005f:0x0000515C:0228:37=Don't you dare say you're going home! C'mon, Mr. Samurai, you're not done talking yet, are you?
uid016f0022.msg:0033:0x000051BC:0234:38=All right, fine. If you insist, I'll have one more.
uid016f0022.msg:0030:0x000051F0:0240:39=Damn right, Saito-san! More drinks! More drinks!
uid016f0022.msg:0082:0x00005223:0264:40=Ah, I see! I see! Different sword styles, the path of the warrior, the joui ideology... The state of affairs is extremely complex!
uid016f0022.msg:004f:0x000052A6:0270:41=(Ugh. I was only going to have one more drink, but he just... kept me talking.)
uid016f0022.msg:0038:0x000052F6:027c:42=Oh, hey, buddy. You're looking tipsy. Feeling all right?
uid016f0022.msg:000d:0x0000532F:0288:43=Yuh—Yeah...
uid016f0022.msg:0028:0x0000533D:0294:44=Hahaha! You really can drink, Saito-san!
uid016f0022.msg:004c:0x00005366:02a0:45=You've told me lots of interesting things so far, but I'm still up for more!
uid016f0022.msg:0053:0x000053B3:02ac:46=Everyone else has given up and gone home by now. What say you and I head elsewhere?
uid016f0022.msg:000a:0x00005407:02b8:47=No. I'm...
uid016f0022.msg:0059:0x00005412:02c4:48=There's a Rakugai izakaya that's said to be stellar! I wager many stories get told there!
uid016f0022.msg:0026:0x0000546C:02d0:49=Rakugai? Wait. No, let's not go there.
uid016f0022.msg:0061:0x00005493:02dc:50=Listen, Rakugai's a very different part of town. People end up dead there if they're not careful.
uid016f0022.msg:0039:0x000054F5:02e8:51=It's definitely too dangerous when we're both this drunk.
uid016f0022.msg:0033:0x0000552F:02f4:52=No! Quit your bellyaching, Saito-san! Let's be off!
uid016f0022.msg:0006:0x00005565:0318:53=H-Hey!
uid016f0022.msg:0037:0x0000556C:0324:54=(Damn it. I'd better go after him before he gets hurt.)
uid016f0022.msg:0020:0x000055A6:0348:55=Mr. Samurai! Up for a round yet?
uid016f0022.msg:0017:0x000055C7:0354:56=You want to drink, huh?
uid016f0022.msg:0020:0x000055DF:0360:57=All right, let's drink a little.
uid016f0022.msg:0045:0x00005600:036c:58=Thanks! <i>Arigato</i>! Mr. Samurai, you're about to make my evening!
uid016f0022.msg:0019:0x00005646:0378:59=Ha! Bottoms up! Let's go!
uid016f0022.msg:002f:0x00005662:039c:60=Sorry, I don't think so. I've got things to do.
uid016f0022.msg:0062:0x00005692:03a8:61=Oh! Meeting up with a girl, I assume? Haha, I know what it's like. I was young once too, you know!
uid016f0022.msg:0047:0x000056F5:03b4:62=Come back again once you've sown your oats! I'm always at this izakaya!
uid016f0022.msg:0003:0x0000573F:03d8:63=Hm?
uid016f0022.msg:002c:0x00005743:03e4:64=(A lot of noise coming from that izakaya...)
uid016f0022.msg:0029:0x00005771:03fc:65=Hahaha! Nice! You're a hell of a drinker!
uid016f0022.msg:0034:0x0000579B:0408:66=Heheh! Think so? Haven't had so much fun in a while!
uid016f0022.msg:0040:0x000057D0:0414:67=Well, no need to stop! What's that story you were telling me...?
uid016f0022.msg:005d:0x00005811:0420:68=Ah, sorry, man. I'd stay, but... You know how it is. Wife's at home, don't want to upset her.
uid016f0022.msg:0059:0x0000586F:042c:69=Thanks a bunch for the sake and for hearing me out! I'm feeling great, let's do it again!
uid016f0022.msg:0038:0x000058C9:0438:70=Oh, you're really going? I wanted to hear more from you.
uid016f0022.msg:0041:0x00005902:0444:71=Well, that's how it goes. Goodbye, buddy. Treat your wife kindly!
uid016f0022.msg:0043:0x00005945:045c:72=Not many people left... Who else looks fun to drink with, I wonder?
uid016f0022.msg:002b:0x0000598A:0474:73=Hey! You, samurai! Come here! C'mon, c'mon!
uid016f0022.msg:0014:0x000059B6:0480:74=Is he talking to me?
uid016f0022.msg:000f:0x000059CB:048c:75=Need something?
uid016f0022.msg:0021:0x000059DB:0498:76=How about a drink? It's my treat.
uid016f0022.msg:002c:0x000059FD:04a4:77=Really? You're just... buying people drinks?
uid016f0022.msg:004e:0x00005A2A:04b0:78=You got it. I'm here to knock 'em back with folks and listen to their stories.
uid016f0022.msg:006f:0x00005A79:04bc:79=Their work, their problems, rumors and whatnot. No limit to what you can learn just listening to people, I say.
uid016f0022.msg:004e:0x00005AE9:04c8:80=Never drank with a samurai before, either! So, come on! I'm buying, after all!
uid016f0022.msg:0020:0x00005B39:04e0:81=All right, let's drink a little.
uid016f0022.msg:0045:0x00005B5A:04ec:82=Thanks! <i>Arigato</i>! Mr. Samurai, you're about to make my evening!
uid016f0022.msg:0019:0x00005BA0:04f8:83=Ha! Bottoms up! Let's go!
uid016f0022.msg:002f:0x00005BBB:0510:84=Sorry, I don't think so. I've got things to do.
uid016f0022.msg:0062:0x00005BEB:051c:85=Oh! Meeting up with a girl, I assume? Haha, I know what it's like. I was young once too, you know!

uid016f0029.msg:0003:0x000015E1:0034:1=Hm?
uid016f0029.msg:0026:0x000015E5:0040:2=(That's unusual, I don't see Satow...)
uid016f0029.msg:003e:0x0000160D:0058:3=Saito-san! Thank goodness you're here! Sato-san is in trouble!
uid016f0029.msg:001c:0x0000164C:0064:4=S-Sato is...? What happened?
uid016f0029.msg:0050:0x00001669:0070:5=A group of Sonno Joui shishi barged into the place and attacked him from behind!
uid016f0029.msg:0019:0x000016BA:007c:6=What!? Where's Satow now?
uid016f0029.msg:0054:0x000016D4:0088:7=I don't know! They gave me a letter for you, Saito-san, and then they took him away!
uid016f0029.msg:0044:0x0000172A:00a0:8="Ernest Satow's life is in your hands now. Come to Mukurogai alone."
uid016f0029.msg:0033:0x0000176F:00ac:9=Bastards. They're holding him captive in Mukurogai.
uid016f0029.msg:0033:0x000017A3:00b8:10=No! They really took him somewhere that dangerous!?
uid016f0029.msg:0047:0x000017D7:00c4:11=Saito-san, if I may... For all of us here, you've got to save Sato-san.
uid016f0029.msg:003f:0x0000181F:00d0:12=Aren't you that regular I met? You drink with Satow a lot, huh?
uid016f0029.msg:0047:0x0000185F:00dc:13=Yeah. And not just me—everyone here considers him their best company.
uid016f0029.msg:0039:0x000018A7:00e8:14=And it's not because he pays for drinks. He's a good man!
uid016f0029.msg:0054:0x000018E1:00f4:15=And they dragged him off, right in front of us. We couldn't do anything to help him.
uid016f0029.msg:002d:0x00001936:0100:16=It's not your fault. They were armed samurai.
uid016f0029.msg:002f:0x00001964:010c:17=Still, I'm ashamed of myself... He's my friend.
uid016f0029.msg:0047:0x00001994:0118:18=Mine too! And I was too frightened of what they might do if I spoke up!
uid016f0029.msg:0055:0x000019DC:0124:19=That was the right call. Any of you might've been killed if you'd tried to intervene.
uid016f0029.msg:000c:0x00001A32:0130:20=Saito-san...
uid016f0029.msg:001a:0x00001A3F:013c:21=Please! Please rescue him!
uid016f0029.msg:001d:0x00001A5A:0148:22=Mm. I will. For all of you...
uid016f0029.msg:0028:0x00001A78:0154:23=And because Satow is my friend, as well.
uid016f0029.msg:0028:0x00001AA1:0160:24=Thank you so much! Be careful out there!
uid016f0029.msg:0045:0x00001ACB:0178:25=(No time to waste. I'll go to Mukurogai and bring Satow back safely.)
uid016f002a.msg:004d:0x0000109A:0040:1=There you are. Saito Hajime-san. Third Division Captain, if I'm not mistaken.
uid016f002a.msg:0024:0x000010E8:004c:2=Are you the one who kidnapped Satow?
uid016f002a.msg:0043:0x0000110D:0058:3=Indeed I am. Tanaka Shinbei of Satsuma. Kawakami told me about you.
uid016f002a.msg:0055:0x00001151:0064:4=I hear you were able to best his iaijutsu. Not only that, you defeated Izo himself...
uid016f002a.msg:0064:0x000011A7:0070:5=You must be something truly special to have felled two butchers. Naturally, I had to see for myself.
uid016f002a.msg:004d:0x0000120C:007c:6=Let Satow go, then. If I'm the one you want, you could have just come for me.
uid016f002a.msg:0052:0x0000125A:0088:7=That's true, I could have. Perhaps it was unseemly to lure you out here like this.
uid016f002a.msg:0038:0x000012AD:0094:8=The thing is... This man's no run-of-the-mill foreigner.
uid016f002a.msg:0027:0x000012E6:00a0:9=What the hell is that supposed to mean?
uid016f002a.msg:007c:0x0000130E:00ac:10=Hm. Allow me to enlighten you. Ernest Satow here is a diplomat—sent straight to us courtesy of the British Foreign Office.
uid016f002a.msg:001c:0x00001392:00c4:11=You work for the government?
uid016f002a.msg:0057:0x000013AF:00d0:12=He reports directly to the British Japan Consular Service. Of course, that's not all...
uid016f002a.msg:0081:0x00001407:00dc:13=His very mission is to gather intelligence for the British. Make reports on our political climate—on the lives of our citizens.
uid016f002a.msg:005b:0x00001489:00e8:14=A foreigner creeping into Japan, looking for weaknesses to exploit when the invasion comes.
uid016f002a.msg:005b:0x000014E5:00f4:15=He's even trying to reach the ear of Saigo Kichinosuke. He wants to manipulate my homeland.
uid016f002a.msg:0024:0x00001541:0100:16=No! It's nothing like that, I swear!
uid016f002a.msg:005c:0x00001566:010c:17=Of course, nominally, Japan and Britain are allies. So, my hands are tied. I can't kill him.
uid016f002a.msg:0044:0x000015C3:0118:18=Unless you smuggle him to the Dead Man's Quarter to bury the body...
uid016f002a.msg:006a:0x00001608:0124:19=Precisely right! Mukurogai is a den of shadows. No one's death here—even a diplomat's—raises eyebrows.
uid016f002a.msg:0042:0x00001673:0130:20=And this way, I have a hostage I can use to force you to fight me.
uid016f002a.msg:003b:0x000016B6:013c:21=Draw your sword, Saito-san. Or I kill this whimpering mole.
uid016f002a.msg:003a:0x000016F2:0148:22=You're disgusting... Fine. You want to fight? Let's do it.
uid016f002a.msg:0026:0x0000172D:0154:23=Heheheh. Everything according to plan.
uid016f002a.msg:001e:0x00001754:0160:24=Let's see that sword of yours!
uid016f002c.msg:0018:0x00001D20:0028:1=No! This isn't possible!
uid016f002c.msg:001c:0x00001D39:0034:2=Back away! Retreat, damn it!
uid016f002c.msg:0034:0x00001D57:004c:3=Sorry it took me so long. I came as soon as I heard.
uid016f002c.msg:001d:0x00001D8C:0058:4=No, no. Thank you, Saito-san.
uid016f002c.msg:0025:0x00001DAA:0064:5=Is it true? You work for the British?
uid016f002c.msg:0065:0x00001DD7:007c:6=Sorry. I wasn't trying to keep it a secret, exactly. It was just never the right time to bring it up.
uid016f002c.msg:0058:0x00001E3D:0088:7=Were you using me this whole time? All of us? Gathering our stories for your government?
uid016f002c.msg:0069:0x00001E96:0094:8=No! No, never! All my research was my own! It had nothing to do with my role as a diplomat! I love Japan!
uid016f002c.msg:0080:0x00001F00:00a0:9=It began as curiosity, but the more people I met, the more I cared for this land as your home rather than as my simple fixation.
uid016f002c.msg:005a:0x00001F81:00ac:10=I would never dream of using the stories you've all shared with me to hurt you in any way.
uid016f002c.msg:0051:0x00001FDC:00b8:11=Why do you still do it? Why have you come this far just to satisfy your interest?
uid016f002c.msg:0066:0x0000202E:00c4:12=In truth, there's someone important I'd like to meet here. Someone who may be vital to Japan's future.
uid016f002c.msg:003c:0x00002095:00d0:13=And before I speak to him, I must become more knowledgeable.
uid016f002c.msg:0013:0x000020D2:00dc:14=I don't understand.
uid016f002c.msg:0043:0x000020E6:00e8:15=I don't think anyone would deny that Japan is struggling right now.
uid016f002c.msg:0070:0x0000212A:00f4:16=Remember what I mentioned before? How the quality of people's lives is plummeting from theft and cost-of-living?
uid016f002c.msg:0042:0x0000219B:0100:17=Everyone knows it, but so few are willing to do anything about it.
uid016f002c.msg:006b:0x000021DE:010c:18=Not like you, Saito-san. You're one of the only people I've met who seems genuinely concerned with helping.
uid016f002c.msg:004a:0x00002251:0124:19=But, I need someone of much greater power. Someone who can move mountains.
uid016f002c.msg:0069:0x0000229C:0130:20=There's only one man like that: Saigo-san. Armies march on his say-so. Whole domains wait on his command.
uid016f002c.msg:0046:0x00002306:013c:21=Saigo Kichinosuke, huh? Is that what Tanaka was talking about earlier?
uid016f002c.msg:007f:0x0000234D:0148:22=Japan's overlong isolationism has weakened it. It's lagging behind. Confrontation with global powers has plunged it into chaos.
uid016f002c.msg:007a:0x000023CD:0154:23=Unless this country stabilizes quickly, it will be overrun. Conquered by nothing more violent than Machiavellian treaties.
uid016f002c.msg:007c:0x00002448:0160:24=If you try to fight back carelessly or allow your weaknesses to be exploited, my home country will make a colony of you all.
uid016f002c.msg:0031:0x000024C5:016c:25=You really think that could happen? Colonization?
uid016f002c.msg:0072:0x000024F7:0178:26=I do... And then, all this beautiful culture, and the people who would preserve it, will be erased from the Earth.
uid016f002c.msg:0052:0x0000256A:0184:27=This isn't paranoia, my friend. This is history, the way it's always been written.
uid016f002c.msg:0029:0x000025BD:0190:28=And you think Saigo can prevent all that?
uid016f002c.msg:0067:0x000025E7:019c:29=The Satsuma Domain once warred with Britain. They were ferocious, despite the gap in military strength.

uid016f002c.msg:0073:0x000026A2:01b4:31=I believe the leader of such a domain must have a truly unique outlook when it comes to his country's preservation.
uid016f002c.msg:004a:0x00002716:01c0:32=I have to speak with him and find out. To ensure Japan can protect itself.
uid016f002c.msg:0058:0x00002761:01cc:33=Well, you certainly got someone's attention. Unfortunately, this time it wasn't Saigo's.
uid016f002c.msg:0061:0x000027BA:01d8:34=Yet I can't stop now. To do so wouldn't merely be giving up on my dreams, but giving up on Japan.
uid016f002c.msg:003d:0x0000281C:01e4:35=On Japan, huh? You're a pretty serious guy when you're sober.
uid016f002c.msg:0071:0x0000285A:01f0:36=Forgive my selfishness, Saito-san. I'm going to need more help from you, finding more memoirs from Japanese folk!

uid016f0031.msg:0016:0x00001BD0:00b8:9=Really? That's sudden.
uid016f0031.msg:0063:0x00001BE7:00c4:10=The Sonno Joui movement has gotten out of control, they fear. For my own safety, they wish me back.

uid016f0034.msg:0015:0x0000281C:01f0:27=So, he's really gone?
uid016f0034.msg:0005:0x00002832:01fc:28=Yeah.
uid016f0034.msg:0049:0x00002838:0208:29=I hope... someday... he can walk through our doors again, without a care.
uid016f0034.msg:0030:0x00002882:0214:30=Walk right in, without a care, huh? Hm. So do I.
uid01730000.msg:002b:0x000008D4:00e8:1=Welcome to the table, ladies and gentlemen.
uid01730000.msg:003e:0x00000900:00f4:2=Today, I'll be guiding you through the rules of Texas Hold'em.
uid01730000.msg:0085:0x0000093F:0100:3=In standard Texas Hold'em, the goal is to form the best hand possible using both the cards in your hand and the five community cards.
uid01730000.msg:0043:0x000009C5:010c:4=The game begins with every player being dealt their two hand cards.
uid01730000.msg:0055:0x00000A09:0118:5=First, take a look at the two cards in your hand, then select Check to end the round.
uid01730000.msg:0055:0x00000A5F:0124:6=All players have bet the same amount, so the game will now proceed to the next round.
uid01730000.msg:0040:0x00000AB5:0130:7=At this point, the community cards will be dealt for you to see.
uid01730000.msg:0057:0x00000AF6:013c:8=One of your cards has the same value as a community card. Therefore, you have one pair.
uid01730000.msg:0098:0x00000B4E:0148:9=The player to your right has not only opted to bet, but they have raised the bet amount as well. This could indicate a certain confidence in their hand.
uid01730000.msg:00b6:0x00000BE7:0154:10=Depending on how confident you feel about your own hand, you can raise (increase the bet), call (match the bet), or fold (quit). However, best not fold now, for the sake of practice.
uid01730000.msg:0055:0x00000C9E:0160:11=All players have bet the same amount, so the game will now proceed to the next round.
uid01730000.msg:0030:0x00000CF4:016c:12=With that, another community card will be dealt.
uid01730000.msg:0027:0x00000D25:0178:13=Note that you still only have one pair.
uid01730000.msg:0080:0x00000D4D:0184:14=Should you find yourself with a less than ideal hand, it may be wise to cut your losses and select Fold to opt out of the round.
uid01730000.msg:0044:0x00000DCE:0190:15=One pair is still something, of course, so let's keep going for now.
uid01730000.msg:00b6:0x00000E13:019c:16=Depending on how confident you feel about your own hand, you can raise (increase the bet), call (match the bet), or fold (quit). However, best not fold now, for the sake of practice.
uid01730000.msg:0041:0x00000ECA:01a8:17=This is the final round. All community cards have now been dealt.
uid01730000.msg:007e:0x00000F0C:01b4:18=Lucky you. The last community card has increased the value of your hand to two pairs. Time to try your luck and raise the bet.
uid01730000.msg:005b:0x00000F8B:01c0:19=Congratulations, you win. You take all the chips that were bet over the course of the game.
uid01730000.msg:0090:0x00000FE7:01cc:20=Some friendly reminders: Bet or raise when you're feeling confident. Check if you want to see how the hand unfolds. Fold if you wish to bow out.
uid01730000.msg:0054:0x00001078:01d8:21=This concludes the tutorial. We hope you'll enjoy all of the games we have to offer.
uid01730004.msg:0078:0x000003C4:0058:1=In the gambling den, you can enjoy online play against people from all around the world and compete on the leaderboards.
uid01730004.msg:0064:0x0000043D:0064:2=Enjoy games such as mahjong, shogi, koi-koi, oicho-kabu, and even a card game from overseas—poker.
uid01730004.msg:0060:0x000004A2:0070:3=You can play a bonus game once a day to earn betting points you'll need in order to play online.
uid01730004.msg:0094:0x00000503:007c:4=Reveal cards until you draw the old maid. The amount of betting points you earn depends on the number of cards drawn and the numbers on those cards.
uid01730004.msg:0059:0x00000598:0088:5=Win big... or lose big! By fortune or miracle, we hope countless victories come your way!

uid01780014.msg:0073:0x00004941:0078:3=Y-Yes, ma'am... but, just so you know, I never would've bothered a dumpy broad like her if I hadn't been forced to!
uid01780014.msg:003c:0x000049B5:0084:4=Then who made you do it? Make it quick, I've got work to do.

uid01780014.msg:0084:0x00004A30:00a8:6=Okay... So, I was drinking at Watami the other day, then out of nowhere, this guy sits down across from me and slides me some money.
uid01780014.msg:006f:0x00004AB5:00b4:7=He told me he'd picked out a client of yours that he wanted me to string along so he could get her on the hook.
uid01780014.msg:0015:0x00004B25:00c0:8=And who was this guy?
uid01780014.msg:0089:0x00004B3B:00cc:9=I didn't ask, and he didn't say. It definitely seemed like he wasn't working alone on this—the pay after the job was going to be crazy.
uid01780014.msg:0060:0x00004BC5:00d8:10=Well, you may be a little shitbird, but at least you can sing. Who could that guy be, though...?
uid01780014.msg:0043:0x00004C26:00e4:11=All right, I'm done with you. Piss off before I lay you out anyway!

uid01780014.msg:008a:0x00004CAA:0120:15=I'm just glad you're fine. Don't let those kinds of sleazeballs sucker you again, all right? Can't have you owing money to the whole town.
uid01780014.msg:0088:0x00004D35:012c:16=Yeah, I know I was being stupid, but it was the first time a man had been so kind to me, so I just... believed what I wanted to believe.

uid01780014.msg:0082:0x00004DF0:0144:18=But you have to know, there are a lot of creeps out here looking to take advantage of a gal. Promise you'll be more careful, okay?
uid01780014.msg:0065:0x00004E73:0150:19=Got it. I'm going to do what it takes to find someone actually dependable—the way you are, Yae-san.

uid01780014.msg:0029:0x00004FCA:0198:23=Oh, don't worry about it. It was nothing.
uid01780014.msg:0070:0x00004FF4:01a4:24=No, I insist. I know what happens to people who owe one too many favors in this city. You're taking the payment.

uid01780014.msg:0056:0x00005130:0204:30=Well, I'm Yae, Yamamoto Yae. Been a debt collector around these parts for a while now.

uid01780014.msg:008f:0x00005233:0234:34=You saw how some of my clients can be a bit of a hassle to collect from. I bet they'd go a lot smoother if you lent me a big ol' hand of yours.
uid01780014.msg:0032:0x000052C3:0240:35=I'll make it very worth your time. How's it sound?
uid01780014.msg:001d:0x000052F6:024c:36=Not bad. I'll think about it.

uid01780014.msg:0042:0x000053F5:02f4:40=But what happened to the money I gave you earlier? It was a lot...
uid01780014.msg:002a:0x00005438:0300:41=Tsh, that chump change? I blew it already.
uid01780014.msg:0026:0x00005463:030c:42=Huh? Wait, you spent it all that fast?
uid01780014.msg:006d:0x0000548A:0318:43=Look, it costs a lot to make dreams come true. I'm trying to maintain connections with important people here!
uid01780014.msg:004b:0x000054F8:0324:44=But... I gave you everything, even what I was saving for starting a family.
uid01780014.msg:0089:0x00005544:0330:45=Well, what <i>I</i> wanna know is, where's that twenty ryo I told you to get me? I said I needed it by today, didn't I? Well, Okiku-chan?
uid01780014.msg:0043:0x000055CE:033c:46=I... I don't know how I can pay it all back if I borrow any more...
uid01780014.msg:0084:0x00005612:0348:47=Ah, I already thought of that. That's why I went and found a place that'll lend some money even to you. They'll be here anytime now.
uid01780014.msg:0046:0x0000569A:0378:48=Hey, Bunkichi, been waiting long? Is this the lady looking for a loan?
uid01780014.msg:0057:0x000056E1:0384:49=Listen—we're real generous, sweetie. We even brought the money to lend you right now.

uid01780014.msg:0039:0x00005764:039c:51=I told you already—they just came here to help you out.
uid01780014.msg:0048:0x0000579E:03a8:52=We don't have any restrictions on our loans. Borrow as much as you like.
uid01780014.msg:0056:0x000057E7:03b4:53=Take it before it's too late, Okiku-chan! I need it, honey. We need it! For our dream.
uid01780014.msg:0044:0x0000583E:03c0:54=It's just, I... I really can't pay back any more than I already owe.
uid01780014.msg:0040:0x00005883:03cc:55=(I don't like what's happening here... Is she going to be okay?)

uid01780014.msg:0086:0x000058E3:03f0:57=Well, look at this sorry group of asses ready for the kicking. Are you stupid enough to think I'd let you swipe her out from under me?

uid01780014.msg:005b:0x00005978:0408:59=And are you stupid too or something? How many times have I told you to dump this slimeball?
uid01780014.msg:0035:0x000059D4:0414:60=Who're you, lady? As if any of this is your business.
uid01780014.msg:0091:0x00005A0A:0420:61=Funny—because it sure as shit <i>is</i> my business. You see, Okiku-san's one of my clients. You take money from her, you're taking it from me.
uid01780014.msg:0067:0x00005A9E:0444:62=Hmm... Collects debts... Badass attitude... Got a dragon on her back... Holy crap, are you Miss Tatsu!?
uid01780014.msg:0036:0x00005B06:0450:63=Heh. Yeah, a chump like you <i>would</i> call me that.
uid01780014.msg:007a:0x00005B3D:045c:64=Well, you might be in the finance scene too, but we've got business to do here! So, leave this deal for the men to settle!

uid0178002a.msg:004f:0x00000C5C:0040:2=This one's sort of a blockhead, but he's an alright guy, all things considered.
uid0178002a.msg:0046:0x00000CAC:004c:3=All his money goes towards feeding his wife, ever since she took sick.
uid0178002a.msg:0087:0x00000CF3:0058:4=They'd been married for years when one day, she just collapsed. It really scared him. He couldn't even tell me about it without crying.
uid0178002a.msg:0084:0x00000D7B:0064:5=Plus, he works hard, so I factor all that stuff into his account. Got him on a real low-interest setup until his wife pulls through.
uid0178002a.msg:002b:0x00000E00:0070:6=So, you're actually a bit of a softie, huh?
uid0178002a.msg:0054:0x00000E2C:007c:7=Haha! These people treated me well in the past. Just wanna return the favor, is all.

uid0178002a.msg:0025:0x00000ECA:00dc:10=Oh, no. Saito-san, help me carry her!
uid0178002a.msg:000f:0x00000EF0:00e8:11=Yes, of course.
uid0178002b.msg:0032:0x000011ED:0034:1=Thank you, Yae-chan, kind samurai... You saved me.
uid0178002b.msg:0040:0x00001220:0040:2=I'm just glad we were there. What in the world happened, though?
uid0178002b.msg:0062:0x00001261:004c:3=Well, some strangers came by earlier... They were debt collectors, and... they took my Zenji away.
uid0178002b.msg:004a:0x000012C4:0058:4=Debt collectors...? Wait, was Zenji-san borrowing from someone besides me?
uid0178002b.msg:006b:0x0000130F:0064:5=You know, that surprised me, too. They said they'd lent him an unbelievable sum so I could get treatment...
uid0178002b.msg:007a:0x0000137B:0070:6=Hang on, though—I thought your issue was a dietary thing. That's what he told me when he came to me for money, anyway...
uid0178002b.msg:007c:0x000013F6:007c:7=Yes, and thanks to the both of you, I've been feeling much better lately. So, I have no clue why he'd take out another loan!
uid0178002b.msg:0052:0x00001473:0088:8=Something's smelling real rotten here. Do you think Zenji-san could've been duped?
uid0178002b.msg:0023:0x000014C6:0094:9=Duped how? I mean, why would he...?
uid0178002b.msg:0018:0x000014EA:00a0:10=What makes you say that?
uid0178002b.msg:0063:0x00001504:00b8:11=Well, there's a lender in town who's been expanding his business by bullshitting potential clients.
uid0178002b.msg:0084:0x00001568:00c4:12=He tricks people into signing contracts, then once he's squeezed 'em for every last mon, they're forced to work till they keel over.
uid0178002b.msg:007c:0x000015ED:00d0:13=I heard he sometimes bribes doctors to tell suckers they need to shell out for expensive medicine, just to hook new clients.
uid0178002b.msg:008a:0x0000166A:00dc:14=This kind of thing's only been getting worse around here... It's at the point where I can't help all the folks getting ripped off anymore.
uid0178002b.msg:0038:0x000016F5:00e8:15=Not sure what else I can do to help these poor people...
uid0178002b.msg:0064:0x0000172E:00f4:16=You're only human. You were never going to be able to help everybody. We just do what we can, right?
uid0178002b.msg:0077:0x00001793:0100:17=Heh, yeah, you got me there... Speaking of doing something, I think I have an idea where they might've taken Zenji-san.
uid0178002b.msg:008a:0x0000180B:010c:18=Saito-san, sorry to ask—I'm gonna need you to back me up this time, too. But I really want to save Zenji-san, and I can pay you. Please?

uid0178002b.msg:0083:0x000018CB:0124:20=He was probably taken to a gambling den. These guys talk people into blowing money for them, then ask how they plan to pay it back.
uid0178002b.msg:0072:0x0000194F:0130:21=Yae-chan, my husband's not a bad man. He's always intended to pay you back. So please, please, please... Save him.
uid0178002b.msg:004c:0x000019C2:013c:22=I know, Otami-san. Don't worry, I'll bring him back. Just wait for us, okay?

uid0178002c.msg:006e:0x000011D9:0034:1=Aw, what the hell, Zenji-san? We showed you the ticket to easy money. How'd ya screw yourself over even worse?

uid0178002c.msg:008b:0x00001614:00d0:13=And <i>you</i> should understand that you're forcing people into contracts illegally. Plus, if you take Zenji-san now, I'll never get paid.
uid0178002c.msg:0086:0x000016A0:00dc:14=What do I care!? We've got signed contracts. He borrowed more than twice what he owes you. Bitch all you want—the guy's on our hook.

uid0178002d.msg:0016:0x0000A23E:08c4:125=Even—and I'm all in.
uid0178002d.msg:0008:0x0000A255:08d0:126=All in!?
uid0178002d.msg:001c:0x0000A25F:08e8:127=Oh, you are so full of shit!
uid0178002d.msg:0054:0x0000A27C:08f4:128=Hmph, she doesn't know the first thing about cho-han. She's in for a rude awakening.
uid0178002d.msg:0032:0x0000A2D1:0900:129=(Yae's going for the finishing blow this round...)
uid0178002d.msg:0015:0x0000A307:0930:130=All right... Game on!
uid0178002d.msg:0019:0x0000A31F:0954:131=It's... snake eyes! Even!
uid0178002d.msg:0027:0x0000A339:0960:132=You did it!!! You're amazing, Yae-chan!
uid0178002d.msg:002b:0x0000A361:096c:133=What the fuck... How'd she see that coming?
uid0178002d.msg:004f:0x0000A38D:0978:134=Well, that's not what I wanted to see. You know what you have to do now, right?
uid0178002d.msg:0051:0x0000A3DD:0984:135=After all, it's pretty common for folks to disappear from gambling dens nowadays.
uid0178002d.msg:0025:0x0000A430:099c:136=Ah! Please, please wait, Kurata-sama!
uid0178002d.msg:0042:0x0000A456:09a8:137=Heh... That was pretty damn exciting, especially there at the end.
uid0178002d.msg:0031:0x0000A499:09b4:138=Saito-san, did you hear me say we were done here?
uid0178002d.msg:0004:0x0000A4CB:09c0:139=Huh?
uid0178002d.msg:0027:0x0000A4D0:09cc:140=I'm doublin' down! Whaddaya say, prick?
uid0178002d.msg:0023:0x0000A4F8:09d8:141=Fuuuuck! Just walk away already...!
uid0178002d.msg:0027:0x0000A51C:09e4:142=Aw, too scared? Don'tcha have a system?
uid0178002d.msg:0014:0x0000A544:09f0:143=Oh, you cocky bitch!
uid0178002d.msg:0039:0x0000A55B:0a14:144=You know what? Fuck dice! We're just gonna beat your ass!
uid01780044.msg:001e:0x00000FB9:0034:1=So, you're really leaving Kyo?
uid01780044.msg:001a:0x00000FD8:0040:2=My mind's already made up.
uid01780044.msg:001e:0x00000FF3:004c:3=I see... What's the next step?
uid01780044.msg:0023:0x00001012:0058:4=For starters, some studying in Edo.
uid01780044.msg:0014:0x00001036:0064:5=Oh, going to school?
uid01780044.msg:0044:0x0000104B:0070:6=You saw Kurata's paper trail—he had victims even outside the city.
uid01780044.msg:0067:0x00001090:007c:7=No matter how much I do for Kyo as Miss Tatsu the debt collector, there'll still be people who need me.
uid01780044.msg:007f:0x000010F8:0088:8=After thinking about it, I realized, maybe all those desperate people would have stronger odds if they'd had better educations.
uid01780044.msg:0079:0x00001178:0094:9=Now, I want to build a place where <i>anyone</i> can learn as much as they want. To hell with that "educated elite" shit.
uid01780044.msg:004a:0x000011F2:00a0:10=And you know me—once I get an idea, it's like a fire's lit under my ass.
uid01780044.msg:0027:0x0000123D:00ac:11=Well, that's definitely a big decision.
uid01780044.msg:008c:0x00001265:00b8:12=Yeah, not really sure on the "how"s, but that's why I'm going to Edo. I figure, a few years of schooling there, and I'll have it worked out.
uid01780044.msg:0028:0x000012F2:00c4:13=I'll be rooting for you from here, then.
uid01780044.msg:0017:0x0000131B:00d0:14=Well, time to head out.
uid01780044.msg:0046:0x00001335:00f4:15=Saito-san... Sorry to leave without paying you for the last job yet...
uid01780044.msg:001f:0x0000137C:0100:16=Yeah, don't forget. You owe me.
uid01780044.msg:002f:0x0000139C:010c:17=And you bet your ass I'll pay you back someday!
uid01780044.msg:0067:0x000013CE:0130:18=(When someone like her puts their mind to something... I'll bet Yae makes her dream a reality one day.)
uid01780045.msg:0037:0x00000B08:0058:1=Hold it. State your business... Gah! You're Miss Tatsu!
uid01780045.msg:0058:0x00000B40:0064:2=And you've gone from loan shark to doorman for a kidnapper, huh? Sure must suck to suck.
uid01780045.msg:007b:0x00000B99:0070:3=Oh, fuck you! I'm stuck out here chokin' down cold rice because of you! You're not gettin' through here in a million years.
uid01780045.msg:008e:0x00000C15:007c:4=Well, I have much more important things to do than argue with talking pieces of shit, so I'm just going to beat your ass and head on in, okay?
uid01780045.msg:0050:0x00000CA4:0088:5=I'm sick of your uppity fuckin' attitude! Get out here, boys! We've got company!
uid01780045.msg:0016:0x00000CF6:00a0:6=Let's rage, Saito-san!
uid01780045.msg:0006:0x00000D0D:00ac:7=Right!
uid01780046.msg:0031:0x00002AB5:0044:1=I'll take care of this. You go find the hostages.
uid01780046.msg:0026:0x00002AE7:0050:2=All right. Good luck with these dicks.
uid01780046.msg:003c:0x00002B0F:0068:3=You meddling asshole, you think you can get away with this!?
uid01780046.msg:004b:0x00002B4C:0074:4=I know all about the racket you're running. I suggest you turn yourself in.
uid01780046.msg:006c:0x00002B98:0080:5=Hahaha, turn myself in? Take a look around. If we're talking crimes, <i>you're</i> the one trespassing here!
uid01780046.msg:006f:0x00002C05:008c:6=If a doshin hears a commotion and comes calling, both you <i>and</i> that bitch are getting hauled off to jail!
uid01780046.msg:003b:0x00002C76:00a4:7=Hahaha, and here he is now! Hope you enjoy being locked up!
uid01780046.msg:0034:0x00002CB4:00c8:8=Stop in the name of the law—what's going on here!?
uid01780046.msg:004a:0x00002CE9:00d4:9=Can't you see? I'm dealing with a burglary here! Hurry up and arrest them!
uid01780046.msg:005a:0x00002D34:00e0:10=We're only here to free the hostages he's holding on his property. He's the real criminal.
uid01780046.msg:001c:0x00002D8F:00ec:11=Wha... What!? Is that true!?
uid01780046.msg:0042:0x00002DAC:00f8:12=Of course not! He's just trying to avoid arrest! Now, do your job!
uid01780046.msg:0054:0x00002DEF:0104:13=You don't have to take my word for it. Just listen to what these people have to say.
uid01780046.msg:0006:0x00002E46:0128:14=What!?
uid01780046.msg:0056:0x00002E4D:0134:15=It's true! We were all scammed and kidnapped! They were about to sell me to a brothel!
uid01780046.msg:003d:0x00002EA4:0140:16=I swear it's true. They talked about it right in front of me!
uid01780046.msg:0061:0x00002EE2:014c:17=I-I was also scammed... They tricked me into signing a contract with an impossible interest rate.
uid01780046.msg:0055:0x00002F44:0158:18=They told me they were going to make me work in the coal mines and take all my pay...
uid01780046.msg:008a:0x00002F9A:0164:19=I just needed money for my father's medicine... Next thing I knew, I was overwhelmed with debt and getting dragged here by <i>his</i> men.
uid01780046.msg:0026:0x00003025:0170:20=How the... How did you all get out...?
uid01780046.msg:0044:0x0000304C:017c:21=I'd say you've heard enough that you can't rule out the possibility.
uid01780046.msg:0012:0x00003091:0188:22=Indeed, this is...
uid01780046.msg:0073:0x000030A4:0194:23=Wait, wait! None of this is evidence, just baseless accusations! You're not doing anything here without real proof!
uid01780046.msg:001d:0x00003118:01a0:24=Hold it right the hell there!
uid01780046.msg:0026:0x00003137:01b8:25=Um, what I meant to say before, was...
uid01780046.msg:001e:0x0000315E:01c4:26=I'm guessing that's our proof.
uid01780046.msg:007f:0x0000317D:01d0:27=Not just the illegal loan contracts, either—forged seals, underhanded schemes with doctors, logs for human trafficking deals?
uid01780046.msg:0030:0x000031FD:01dc:28=Real dipshit move, sitting on all this evidence.
uid01780046.msg:0067:0x0000322F:01f4:29=So, Kurata, are you really as stupid as you look? Or have you finally figured out that you're screwed!?
uid01780046.msg:0048:0x000032A1:0230:30=Okay, that's one hard part done. Now, let's hurry and find the hostages!
uid01780046.msg:001c:0x000032EA:023c:31=We'd better make this quick.
uid01780046.msg:008a:0x0000330A:026c:32=Ah, if it isn't Miss Tatsu... Or should I say, Yamamoto Yae? So you were the one raising hell out here. How dare you intrude on my estate.
uid01780046.msg:004d:0x00003395:0278:33=Well, if it isn't the top shit himself? I remember you from the gambling den.
uid01780046.msg:0067:0x000033E3:0284:34=And I definitely remember you, considering your winning streak. You took home quite a bit of our money.
uid01780046.msg:0058:0x0000344B:0290:35=You mean I took home my <i>own</i> money. You come for my clients, I come for your cash.
uid01780046.msg:002d:0x000034A4:029c:36=So, what can I do for you, this late an hour?
uid01780046.msg:0068:0x000034D2:02a8:37=I probably should've mentioned—I'm coming for my clients, too. I know you're holding 'em hostage here.
uid01780046.msg:0087:0x0000353B:02b4:38=It seems you know nothing about my business. I merely provide financial opportunities that these people entered of their own free will.
uid01780046.msg:0088:0x000035C3:02c0:39=I'm about to pound that business talk right out of you. You prey on people and force them into slavery! And I'm taking 'em with me, now!
uid01780046.msg:0087:0x0000364C:02cc:40=Untrained bitches sure do bark a lot. Fortunate that I hire people who are <i>very</i> good at training. Do your best with her, Sensei.
uid01780046.msg:0024:0x000036D6:02f0:41=Here we go... Better brace yourself.
uid01780046.msg:0023:0x000036FB:02fc:42=You don't gotta tell me, Saito-san!
